First off, I want to objective and say that the program is not at all malignant, but at the same time is not as \"flat hierarchy,\" as people make it seem.    First off, re collegiality. I want to rephrase this as everyone is \"nice.\" And at the same time, everyone expects you to be nice. Now, I don't want anyone to conflate this with polite, because everyone should be expected to be polite. But Mayo expects everyone to be Minnesota nice and often times, people are taken aback and offended by relatively benign things, such as answering a question, but not looking directly at them because you're busy putting in orders in a chart. This is small potatoes, but ultimately very emotionally draining. (+1 Not OP but someone who went here)    Rochester -- often the location is thought to be a deterrant, but people often say that affordability makes up for some of it. I call BS. By no means is it as expensive as big cities like LA, SF, or NYC, but there is a significant amount of price gouging for rent and restaurants because Mayo dominates the area, and so there is an expectation that people can afford higher prices. The small number of good restaurants is a small escape from the stress of residency, but the ridiculous prices make them a sparing indulgence.     In terms of education, I will agree that for education in almost any IM subspeciatly, Mayo is second to none. I acutally want to pursue a specialty myself. But I want into IM also because I wanted to be a good generalist, and this is quite lacking. I sincerely believe the hosptialists at my mid-tier medical school were much more well-versed internists because they weren't able to so easily rely on sub-specialty consults like at Mayo. I remember wanting to start one of my primary care patients on Insulin and they attending shook their head and said, just send them to endocrine. That is one example of bread and butter medicine that you miss out on by doing your training at Mayo. It is true also that Resident clinic sees a relatively underserved population, but this is all relative and there is no denying that Rochester is affluent compared to the rest of the country. This would not be a good place for people looking to work with the underserved.     Carrie Thompson, our program director. I want to say that she is somewhat benign. However, there have been some concerns about her ability to run the program well since she starte a few years ago. There have been complaints that the quality of fellowship matches has decreased since she took over, and reports of her not advocating for her residents as past program directors have. I know this is somewhat annoying to complain about, but THE MAYO CLINIC, should not have trouble matching their applicants to good programs. I can't speak to much more directly about fellowship matches since I myself haven't even applied, but I wills say some of the complaints appear well founded. Dr. Thompson really does give off an air of \"she will go to bat for you if she likes you.\" However, if she doesn't like you or is even neutral about you but you're a good doctor otherwise, doing well in the program, no professional complaints, she won't support you in your endeavors as she should as program director. This is upsetting because your career prospects should hinge on your performance as a doctor and not on the whims of a program director. Again, I know small potatoes in the grand scheme of how toxic residency can be, but Mayo Clinic will try to advertise itself as a perfect environment otherwise to overcome the poor appeal of Rochester, and I just want to say, that is not true at all.",

    "2023": "NYU has fostered a culture of silence and retaliation beyond probably any other program. They've actively encouraged residents to snitch on each other about social media posts. Besides Zaki Masoud, several residents across departments have been threatened and told to stop posting about Palestine. Regardless of your personal politics it's clearly a malignant institution if this is the environment they're fostering among co-residents. <- Any current residents can comment? I didnt get this vibe <<Without specifics on what was being posted and how the residents are being threatened, this is a relatively meaningless accusation. Politics are controversial at baseline, middle eastern politics are of the most heated nature, and it is perfectly reasonable for a program to encourage residents to avoid posting anything that can be regarded as inflammatory and offensive. If this is really of a serious nature, please give some specifics of the content and/or threats +100 << he got reinstated anwyays <<< maybe the resident should have avoided being a dumbass online      stepping away from politics, I'm disappointed with the silence surrounding their brooklyn program, their recruitment tactics, and their fellowship matches. NYU-BK may as well be an entirely different program/hospital in ERAS but instead it is listed as a \"track\" within the main hospital, which was incredibly misleading. NYU-BK interview day was the only way I could see any fellowship matches from their their residents, but they were extremely shady and mixed those fellowshipt matches among those from the main NYU IM program. Other than that, they seem to hide this information elsewhere online. I'm amazed someone was able to post under the fellowship match tab where the NYU fellowship matches were from, it seems liek this info was somehow leaked by smeone in the program which I really appreciate because it's very hard to find online.",
    "2024": "Current resident: I won't address the political comments in the shame comment or the brooklyn program issue. I'll be focusing more on the NYU main program in Manhattan (Tisch and Bellevue tracks). Of the major manhattan programs, NYU is perhpas the *best* when it comes to ancillary tasks. Tisch hospital is incredible in regards to lab draws getting done, imaging happening quickly, etc. I don't know why exactly the nursing at Tisch / Kimmel hospital do so much (I guess they're not unionized?) but they do. I truly feel like some days I don't need to leave my desk unless it's to assess a sick patient; it's probably one of the few places where an IM resident can practice at the top of their license. There's not even a concept of calling to make an appointment or performing your own draws, it's not even a question here. On some services in Tisch, they even have PAs do discharges for you. Truly an incredibly well-oiled machine. Bellevue is of course a different story, but in \"faming\" the program I would like to point out that the program leadership escalated nursing issues with hospital leadership, and now there are q4 phlebotomy rounds. This means that in day-to-day work, very rarely will you need to draw your own routine lab. You will still have to ultrasound hard-sticks, and you will be responsible in rapids & codes on the floors, but it is not nearly as bad as some other programs are in Manhattan. One thing to note is that though there is immense diversity in the major NYU hospital systems, they're also all within 9 blocks of each other. Commuting is not at all a concept at the main program, which helps with work-life balance. Finally, program leadership at the main program is very responsive and open to feedback. There have been several major and minor changes that have been addressed while I've been here, mostly resident-suggested. While the Brookyln program issue is unfortunate and honestly awkward, the main program deserves some praise. <<what \"brooklyn program issue\" are you referring to, speficically?",
