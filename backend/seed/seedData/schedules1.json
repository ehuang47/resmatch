Also guaranteed average of 1 day off per week during the 3, giving you 5 days off per month, which is above the ACGME requirement of 4 days off per month which most academic residency programs abide by very strictly. Also large residency class makes it very easy to get consecutive days off if you need to go to a wedding or something. Also we are one of the highest paid residency programs now because of our union. LA can be very expensive so it was long overdue. I would strongly recommend factoring in whether a program has a union if you're planning on living in a city/high COL area. Oh and 55 person size.

Rest is elective and clinic time where you might also have assigned coverage. For the remaining two years together, you have to senior 4-5m general wards, 1m CCU, 1m MICU, 3m of inpatient subspecialty wards (pick between hepatology (2wks inpt/consults), cardiology (2wks inpt/consults), oncology, & VA ICU), and at minimum 1wk of ccu nights and 2 wk of MICU nights.

Rochester may not be for everyone although it is very affordable on a resident salary and the city has experienced a lot of growth over the past 10-15 years due to a large investment in the city by Mayo. In terms of patient population, Mayo serves a large local catchment area but also gets patients from all over the country/world. All of the resources make it easier to set your patients up for success and they are generally very appreciative of the care they get here. WIll see a diverse range of patients/conditions given the mix of patient populations but also a higher number of relatively well-off patients on certain outpatient subspeciality rotations compared to other places. Resident continuity clinic sees a higher percentage of underserved patients compared to non-resident community internal medicine practices.

    "comments": "Very different experiences across the three hospitals. You have the ability to spend more time in the private or public hospital based on your preference. Private hospital (tisch-kimmel) has good ancillary services -> imaging gets done quickly, phelbotomy/nursing do all blood draws/IVs. However, there is pressure to discharge patients quickly and hit different metrics to support the hospital's usnews ranking and bottom line (and executive compensation). Bellevue is a safety net hospital where you will see crazy pathology but the hospital would crash and burn and the patients would die if it wasn't for the residents"

On weekends, can sign out at noon if not on call. The price you pay is having to do relatively more night float throughout residency, but not more than at other programs. Less elective time during intern year, but lots of elective time PGY2/3 years. If applying for fellowship, chiefs work to concentrate elective time at beginning of PGY3 to help with interviews."
