ALABAMA	Birmingham	Very affordable, no traffic, easy parking, lots of green space, great food with some nationally-acclaimed restaurants (and can afford to go on resident's salary). Hiking within 15min of the hospital and tons more options within an hour's drive. Small town friendliness with mid-sized city amenities. < Many larger cities within easy driving distance (Atlanta, New Orleans, Nashville) and beaches in S Alabama/FL panhandle	Church and college football can play an oversized role in city life. Still can feel very segregated. Local and state politics filled with corruption. High monthly water bills due to aforementioned corruption. The worest roads of any city, seriously had a tire bust from going 40 and hitting a pot hole.	They're trying to improve it, but not great. Definitely need a car+2	Hot and humid summers. Mild winters. Snow is rare. Tornadoes are a thing.	Most people are married by 25 and arent interested in dating anyone more distant than a fourth cousin. Pretty religious down here. << this is absurd. people in birmingham aren't incestuous. It feels like there's someone here with a thing against bham	Not great; improving though+1	meh<< Very diverse in the city, less so in rural areas <<sure its better than other parts of alabama...but no way in hell would i call it "very diverse" << do you actually live in Birmingham proper??	its weird because there are less people in birmingham I feel unsafe around compared to other cities...but for the people feel unsafe around..I feel 100x less safe around them compared to your typical urban bozo. These people are legit crazy. Will follow you relentlessly or point a gun/knife at you. Fucking terrifying. Not just birmingham but Alabama as a whole << I have lived here 20 years, never had a single person follow me with a gun/knife, however Birmingham is consistently listed as one of the most murderous cities in the country
ALABAMA	Huntsville	Similar pros as Birmingham but with a bit less to do. Actually has a lot of people from different areas of the country, likely due to the big military contracting and NASA presence	Areas immediately surrounding Huntsville are some of the most conservative areas in the entire state. Less racial diversity than Birmingham		Same as Birmingham, maybe a little colder in the winter	great city if you're trying to cheat on your spouse, or shag someone else's spouse. Huntsville, Ala. was ranked the 11th most unfaithful city in the country			Very safe
ALABAMA	Mobile	COL	Hurricanes +1						
ARIZONA	Phoenix	Affordable housing, good mix of food options, easy parking, traffic is minimal, lots of outdoor activities, easy to drive to Flagstaff which is a true beauty and has skiing/snowboarding in the winter.	Hot as balls	Not great, will definitely need a car. Things are fairly spread apart. But if you live close to the light rail, this can be a decent way to get around. << I thought the RAIL is infamously sketchier than LRs in other big cities	Hot summers >120 F. Chilly in the winters, but not cold. Snow if you go to Northern AZ. <<over 120 is pretty rare (happened once for me living there for 4years), though 108-115F was not.	Good dating scene. << Questionable - depends on what you're looking for<<elaborate	Not bad, not great.	Certain areas are not terribly diverse, but more diversity in East Valley (Tempe, Mesa, Gilbert, Chandler). << Personally found much more diversity in Central Phoenix area, which has been changing a lot over the past 5 years or so. Lots of little gay bars, great options for food with every kind of cuisine from family run restruants. Gentrification is becoming a problem, but the communities west of central used to be full of Spanish speaking and immigrant/first gen families.	
ARIZONA	Scottsdale	Good brunch options, close to both downtown Phoenix and the East Valley.Old Town area is nice, decent dash of culture.	More expensive area in regards to food and housing. North Scottsdale is nothing but big shopping areas and chain restraunts.	Will need a car.	Summers are hot.	Good.	Middle of the road.		
ARIZONA	Tucson	Very Affordable CoL. Cooler than the Phoenix Metro area during summers and the city cools off at night. Tucson gets a short monsoon season of about 1month mid summer with thunderstorms, but otherwise is very sunny. Very mild winters. The university-based IM program is older and more established in the match, though Phoenix has been catching up. // Coming from a larger city, I didn't like Tucson at first but honestly it's grown on me. There a lot of fun things to do, relatively good food, and you can be active outdoors year-round (though you should stick to the twilight hours in the summer). Mount Lemmon is ~30min from the city and is hightly accessable with hiking, camping, or world-class rock climbing (plus a 20-30degF temperature drop when you want to cool down). Tons of scenic hikes and national park just a few hour's drive, or drive a few hours down to the beach in Mexico!	With the exception of a few nicer areas (ex. Catalina Foothills), the public schools are not good. In my opinion, the city looks rather worn down. Summers are pretty hot // I absolutely hate driving here, it's a mix of erratic college kids and retirees on the roads, and lots of pedestrians crossing busy streets making traffic dangerous. There are light ordinances in the city keeping it very very dark at night. Poor highway access so it takes forever to get anywhere.	Will need a car // I have a few friends who live by bicycle/streetcar/Lyft but it is definitely not convenient // I lived here for 8 years without a car and it was definitely doable but not convenient	Hot summers (110's, it's a dry heat), mild winters (60-70's and sunny)	Mostly medical community (MSers, residents, fellows, RNs, etc) and undergrads, IMO // Lots of military due to the AFB, engineers at Raytheon	B	Tucson has a fairly even mix between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (2020 census), but not much representation from other races // Large, unique indigenous population and a hub for asylees. You will interact with ICE in the UofA hospital.	Mostly petty theft - I've had my bike or bike parts stolen multiple times despite getting creative with locks. The University now has better bike lockers though.
ARKANSAS	Jonesboro	???	67% republican	???			fuk no	kinda racist	
ARKANSAS	Little Rock	Low cost of living, not much traffic, no public transportation (need a car), easy access to hiking. The city is somewhat diverse, but not so much as you go towrads to the suburbs	Not a very exciting night life scene, restaurant scene is improving but certain cuisines are still underrepresented here.	not reliable, car city. Low traffic though.	All 4 seasons, mild winter with ~1 snow day/year	hahahaha		White majority although not by much (45%) compared to African American (41%). Latino and Asian populations growing although still clear minority. Everyone's v nice tho, never experienced racial discrimination here. Little Rock is one of the few left-leaning cities in Arkansas	
CALIFORNIA	Fresno	Most of the state is within 1-5 hours of driving distance. Yosemite is a short drive away. <<<how far is it from the beach?	In the middle of Central Valley. It gets very hot. We'd get random sand storms too. Rent is also steadily increasing due to it's proximity to the bay area. Far away from both LA and Bay Area, absolutely nothing to do in Fresno itself.	Car	Very arid, hot summers. Also poor air quality especially during wildfires. <- so basically grass is green lol		Somewhat tolerant. Clovis (northeast & suburban) as well as surrounding cities (Madera, Visalia, Hanford, ect) are quite conservative.	not bad	
CALIFORNIA	Loma Linda	Cheaper than LA, friendly community, small town vibes, close to nature stuff	Not LA, in Inland Empire	Non-existent	>110 F summers, you get three seasons +/- winter	Try looking else where	LGBTQ scene is small	Heavily Hispanic/Spanish-speaking population, Med Center has a diverse staff	
CALIFORNIA	Los Angeles	West La (Santa Monica, Westwood, Brentwood, Beverly Hills where UCLA and Cedars Sinai are located are completely different than places like USC. I have lived in the Bay, OC, and Westwood/Brentwood and Westwood is easily the best place I have ever lived. Some homeless but they haven't taken over and it feels very safe to walk out late at night. Infinite night time activities and an amazing food scene. The Hailey Bieber smoothie is goated, dont care if it costs $20->It's LA    can someone speak to USC locations << Blocks directly around USC is fine, but 3-4 blocks further is dangerous. Rent is sky-high.	Traffic, air quality, getting crowded, everything is very spread out - have to drive a lot to get to things >It's LA  Rent on the cheaper end can be around ~$2k (or slightly less) but you sacrifice having some appliances for more space or vice versa (in west LA area)  Homelessness is unfortunately prevalent	Not great but exists >> it's LA	Can get really hot, summer almost all year, dry<< you can just go to the beach>> Does not apply to UCLA, weather is best in the US IMO. Rarely gets above ninety and is in the 60s-80s for most of the year with tons of sunshine. Never had AC when I lived there for undergrad and only uncomfortable 1-2 weeks of the year << agree with amazing weather at UCLA, though perhaps not as good as San Diego or Hawaii. LA weather can vary quite a bit depending where you live, can get really hot as you go more inland >>It's LA	Lots of wannabe models and actors/actresses  People wanna be young forever, so no one dates seriously until their mid-30s. On the apps, lots of people but everyone is straight up and says they want something casual. All interactions have felt pretty superficial +1 >>> It's LA >> Cap. Massive dating pool and plenty of people looking for serious relationships	It's LA	It's LA	It's LA. Nobody's going to kill you, probably won't get mugged but there's a huge homeless population
CALIFORNIA	Oakland		most dangerous city on the West Coast. period.						
CALIFORNIA	Orange	Disneyland, beach, super diverse food options, mountains not too far away, good hiking trails in South County. Strong esports scene in OC	Disneyland, $$$, traffic--> Is cheaper than good parts of LA and traffic is much better having lived in both. The food in Orange where the medical center is just ok but there is a ton of amazing asian food in the surrounding areas	bus exists, but you need a car	Coastal dry air, comfortable mostly 60s-70s except for summer. Santa Ana winds will chap your lips and the fires will probably double your anthracosis.<<Weather is perfect here lol	Pretty good. I've had several good dates/relationships even as an average looking asian guy	sure	Diverse. South County not so much but north county and central OC you see lots of different races interacting and doing things together. White, asian, hispanic, etc.	
CALIFORNIA	Palo Alto	Lots of nature preserves and great hiking just 10-20 min drive from the hospital. Plenty of different national parks within a 3-4-hour drive, including Yosemite, Pinnacles, Sequoia etc. SF is about a 45 min drive. Awesome food about 10-20 min drive to downtown San Mateo or Mountain View. If you're into venture capital/tech there is obviously a lot of that here.	$$$$, probably the most expensive area in the country not just in terms of rent but general COL. Gas prices generally hover around $4/gallon. Car is a must especially with rotations at SCVMC and the VA. Could bike to the VA, but it may take 30+ min depending on where you live	Bus and Caltrain exist, but you need a car	It's the bay area: fog/cloudy in the morning, sunshine by the afternoon with occasional rain during the winter--> Weather is amazing. Having lived in both West LA/ Santa Monica I prefer Socal to the bay but that is like comparing a ferrari and a lamborghini	Might have a hard time if you're a guy looking for a girl given all the tech guys here \\dating as a girl here is like drowning in an ocean. Many many options, you'll get non-stop nofications on Hinge, but they're all shit. Cringe tech bros who pretend to be progressive but also think women (sorry, "females", as they're called here) are inferior	couldn't be better	Decent, but not comparable to other large metropolitan areas and surrounding suburbs like NYC or LA.	
CALIFORNIA	Riverside/San Bernardino (Inland Empire)	Relatively low cost of living compared to coastal California. Still within an hour drive to LA/OC, 2 hours to San Diego. Mountains are super close by.	Traffic really sucks, rent still much higher than the rest of the country (It's still California after all). Hot as hell in the summertime. Air quality is horrific in the Inland Empire given all the pollution blows here from LA. Not as much nightlife/ food options/ things to do compared to LA/OC. The IE is basically one giant suburb. The city of San Bernardino is worse than Detroit, and this is coming from someone who used to live in the actual city of Detroit.	Almost non-existant. For a metro area of 4.5 million people public transit in the Inland Empire is pathetic	Very very hot in the summer. There are a couple weeks where it is triple digits. Dry heat though. Very pleasant in spring, fall, winter	It sucks. People here are trashier compared to LA/OC. You could date in LA/OC but be prepared to spend an hour minimum oneway in traffic	Not much. Palm Springs has a vibrant and very active LGBT scene but it is further out in the Coachella Valley	About 50% hispanic, 30% white, 20% everyone else. Politically moderate/ leans liberal, but the IE also has strong convervative cities as well (Temecula area/yucaipa/Norco)	
CALIFORNIA	Sacramento	Great foot-pressed wine country, Tahoe, Bay area, etc. Food is great, up and coming downtown/midtown scene, near the state capitol if you're into policy. COL is less than bay area but still pricey, diverse clinical training sites. "Big city with small town feel" lol. Lots of microbreweries, but better wine IMO.	Dry heat, there's like 2 perfect weeks of weather in the spring and fall. Winters are mild, smoke from wildfires has increasingly become an issue. COL high, theres a union but there hasn't been that much progress on things like housing stipends. Crime-ridden and sketchy vibes..	you need a car	pretty great if you have an AC	Most residents are settled down, its a little difficult to date just because its not a big city and is definitely "the midwest of California" (people get married younger compared to thier counterparts in other larger cities in California) >> UCD MS4 here, +1 to the dating scene being challenging (many with a terminal degree of high school). Many residents are in relationships or are married, or chose this program to be near family.	Plenty of queer bars in downtown sac, LGBTQ friendly but could always be better	Third most diverse city in the country!	
CALIFORNIA	San Diego	tacos, weather, beaches, easy access to fun places in Mexico  Food scene is pretty great  Diverse population (outside of North County/La Jolla) < racially, yes. economically, not so much compared to other major cities <-- LMFAO they threw in Republicans	Republicans???? really? < yes especially in la jolla/ del mar/ general north county area lol but there are plenty of liberals. SD is much more white/ rich people than I think people realize (again more in north county though). I think people can also be sort of apathetic regarding politics, social justice issues, etc compared to the rest of CA because SD isnt very diverse economically so there isnt a ton of reason to be if that makes sense  Rent can be expensive, but not as bad as SF/NY/LA; imo food scene is kinda meh outside of Mexican and Italian (restaurants don't make things spicy at all and everything is pretty bland) < Strongly disagree, SD has a lot of great asain restaurants in the Convoy and Mira Mesa areas, lots of great 'Americana' style restaurants as well. PLUS great Mexican and Italian food--> How is the Dim Sum/Ramen/Korean Food scene? I've lived in Bay and LA but is it passable here for residency in terms of asian food? <<i am curious about this last question too???? < SD has good dim sum and ramen, its not LA or Bay area but convoy street has some solid places compared to most other places in the country	Slowly improving- trolley from downtown to La jolla opened recently (takes about 40 minutes)	Summer or slightly colder summer	Big military population; people tend to be on the flaky side	Pretty good, everyone's very chill. Pretty good size community, doesn't feel too much like a fishbowl.	Outside of LJ/North County very diverse patient population with barriers to care particularly at Hillcrest--prevalent meth use and homelessness, SD large refugee resettlement area, patients who are incarcerated, proximity to US-MX border means many patients coming from boder patrol custody/detainment centers	
CALIFORNIA	San Francisco	- You're so close to nature! You have the Golden Gate Park which I recently learned is bigger than NYC's Central Park!  - You're surrounded by ocean :)   - Decent food. A lot of great Asian food in the sunset, great food in the Mission. Decent food truck scene. << Decent? its hands down comparable to LA/NYC. The density isnt as high ofc bc its only 7x7 miles - SF native so sorry im defensive/bias hehe  - Very liberal	Rent :( (most of my med student classmates pay $1200 - $1600 a month not including utilities, for what most people will consider a small room -- and you'll likely be sharing with 2-3 people at that price!)  Very liberal << republicans and conservatives can stay mad. FYI from current med student the shuttle system often won't get you to where you need in time for pre-rounding. Must pay for parking at all three sites. Abudance of car part theft in broad daylight.	Not great but exists and I've used it to get from site to site. There's the MUNI bus system within the city, and then BART and Caltrain to get to East Bay, South Bay. MUNI is very lax on paying. You can probably get by without a car (I went through med school without one) but had close friends who took me to grocery shopping and everything. You will probably need a car if you need to go outside the city frequently (e.g., to Oakland, or if you'll be at Palo Alto for Stanford). UCSF has a free shuttle system between sites. << I think SF/Bay Area has the second-best public transport system across the country (second to NYC). Bay Area native here.	Foggy -- is pretty cold (sorry I think in celsius -- like high 10 Cs) most of the time on the West part of the city, and somewhat sunnier on the east side. Very little rain. Rarely gets below 5 degrees celsius, or above 35 C	- Lots of people using dating apps :) Pretty good dating scene especially for women. Lots of young, ambitious, intellectual types <<cringe tech bros though	As good as it gets :)	unparalleled <- would disagree-- it is very homogenous mostly made up of men in tech who graduated from the same top 3 universities +1 to the latter    I disagree with the 2nd comment with regards to what you will experience in clinical settings. As a UCSF med student who has rotated at UCSF Health, SFVA, SFGH, and Kaiser I have yet to have a patient who was a man in tech. Majority of my patients have been blue collared workers or people who are unemployed and experiencing homelessness. Overall socioeconomically and medically diverse (althought not as diverse as the East Bay). Aside from the VA, I use a translator for about 1/3-1/2 of my patient encounters.	
CALIFORNIA	Santa Barbara								
CALIFORNIA	Ventura	Beaches and mountains around	No good boba place > Agreed > sadness :(						
COLORADO	Denver	Great weather, super close to mountains and very heavy outdoor and craft beer scene	Expensive, food scene not great but improving, not very diverse, bad traffic, Too many white people < wtf is this statement, and Karens. Lots of Karens. << lol who are Karens?? Friend who used to work here said a lot of the patients/nurses can be pretty racist, he was pretty unhappy working here < Current med student, I personally have not run into nurses being racist. The medical centers in Denver serve a large rural, white population and I have had some personal experiences where these patients have made inappropriate racial comments. However I would not use "racist" as a description of the people here...---making racial comments is not racist??? << some white people think that unless you're literally going out and lynching people you can't be racist	Meh, you can get some places with RTD but it could be better. Definitely need a car to get to the mountains	Sunny w/ random snow and occasional tornado threats and wildfire smoke	Good, there has been a lot of population growth with young people	Great	Mostly white, however there is a large hispanic population and refugee population, especially where the Anschutz campus is located in Aurora	
CONNECTICUT	Hartford	West Hartford is pretty hip, small but there's a decent amount of young profesionals in that area; MS4 not from the area who attended for medical school - cheaper than living in Boston or NYC if you want to stay in New England, you will probably want to live in West Hartford which is a short commute to the Hartford hospitals and I would compare it to a trendy suburb (e.g. Bethesda); for being CT there are a lot of random good restaurants, some you have to drive to. West Hartford has all the trendy and overpriced restaurants with a high turnover the last few years, but if you do a decent amount of searching there are some great restaurants in other nearby towns. Fall is beautiful, coming from a place where seasons were not as distinct. Lots of great small hiking spots, and if you don't want to live in a big city, it's nice to have the proximity of Boston and NYC for weekend trips.	COL is getting expensive for the amenities that the state/area has to offer; public transportation is lacking and you need a car to get around anywhere or do anything; food is better than I expected having lived here, but still lacks quite a bit and hole-in-the-wall amazing spots are scattered everywhere across the state; drivers here are terrible contrary to what the drivers themselves think, winters are cold with the pro being that it's well managed and cleared pretty quickly with the appropriate city infrastructure, lot of white people, pretty large socioeconomic gap and it can be very apparent	you need a car	typical New England weather; 4 seasons, cold in the winter with regular snow but for the most part the city/state has the infrastructure to clear it quickly, summers are hot and humid (maybe not as humid as the south), fall is beautiful along with the short spring	uconn is not the ideal place for dating, pretty small and non-diverse population, the only other major industry there is engineering as far as i know<< Difficult for POC    A lot of white people on the dating apps. You'll be surrounded by mostly progressives at work but there is a decent population of conservatives, beware. A lot of "vineyard vines" types of bros who grew up in CT/New England and say they're progressive/liberal but really aren't.		noo goodluck	
CONNECTICUT	New Haven	Excellent food - best pizza in the country (< LOL. NOT TRUE) , great bars, lots of options. Compact, so very bikeable/walkable (< Thank God!). Quick drive or train to NYC or Boston. Hospital is 10 mins down the street (walking) from the Yale Undergrad campus, which has several really nice green spaces/courtyards that people frequent. Neighborhoods are distinct for what you want (downtown has high rises, restaurants, lively night life pre-COVID vs. East Rock is suburban, people have houses, walkable neighborhoods). You get walking distance access to all the other schools within the university. Ubers are plentiful. Food scene is surprisingly good (Indian, Thai, Korean, American, Italian, French, Cuban, Ethiopian, so many other cuisines) << +1 on the food! New Tibetan place just opened and it's spectacular. Also lots of Halal and Kosher restaurant options. <<+2 on food	Weirdly expensive for a small town due to rich yalies / proximity to NYC. you will probably be paying a lot for a dumpy apartment (< what's the cost like for more renovated/modern apartments. Is it like NYC prices?). lots of town/gown issues with very underresourced communities adjacent to sparkling yale-sponsored "downtown" areas <<1600-2200 or so downtown renovated 1br < to be fair, even in the cities with great COL will cost you close to $1500 for 1 bedroom modern/renovated apt in downtown (e.g. cleveland, pittsburgh). < Here for medical school; rent at high end places is expensive (1BR = 1500 for larger apartments with fewer ammenities, 1700-2400 for nicer buildings with all the ammenities). +1, spouse and i pay $2100 for our 2-bed 1-bath place downtown	Not really << Everyone with a Yale ID can use the Yale bus systems. Some routes run 7d a week, and during the week, they start pretty early (I think aby 6:30am). There is an app with the routes. The bus lines go out to East Rock. If you live in an adjacent town, def need a car. << Gonna disagree here. there is a robust public bus system, but for whatever reason *cough elitism cough* Yalies avoid it. goes out to a bunch of the suburbs, like Orange & Hamden. Also New Haven is on the Metro North train line connecting to a bunch of other CT towns/cities as well as to NYC	Four seasons	Per friends - it's not the easiest. There are definitely residents looking for love, just maybe not as many as you would have at a way bigger city/campus. << Lived here for a while: your entire dating scene will be Yale. The grad/professional schools are pretty big, so there are a lot of grad students to date, and of course other residents at the hospital, but most of these people are just passing through New Haven for a short amount of time which creates a weird dynamic...	(i posted this in the IV impressions page as well) For the applicants wondering about being queer/trans in New Haven, I (lived here for medical school for the last 3.5 years) think it's actually pretty great! At least it was pre-Covid. There are a couple gay bars with weekly drag shows and Yale is v queer. My interviewer at Yale actually said the reputation when he was at medical school there was "1 in 4, maybe more" and that goes for all the graduate programs, not just medicine. I've found a pretty great community here, always feel safe, and see other queer people walking around all the time. Obviously not NYC, but it's very reasonable to get down for Pride or a weekend of bar hopping.	Yes. New Haven is lauded as the city that has diversity most reflective of the whole United States. You see plenty of diversity in patients.	
CONNECTICUT	Waterbury	anyone? << More affordable than other CT cities. For example 1,100K for a 2BR with an open parking lot. Will pay more for more amenities, but pretty reasonable! There are nearby trails and state parks (10-15min). Highly connected highway wise to travel north, south, west, east in CT, but the commute is going to be in the 30min + range to other cities. Naugatack, closer than some of the other bigger cities, has a few more restaurants/activities.	Kind of depressing small city. Not a great restaurant scene tbh. You'll likely be travelling elsewhere (i.e New Haven which is a 30-40 min trip/other citities). Might be able to find some hole-in-wall places, but I've been here a couple years and I'm generally underwhelmed. Not really a con persay, but def seems to have a good sized elderly population - so just something to consider if you're looking for a "younger"..."hip"... city	You will need a car. I do see a bus sometimes, but honestly get a car.	4 szns	I haven't tried dating here - but, would probably have greater luck in New Haven vs Waterbury. Friends in New Haven also ended dating folk more in NYC, and a little in New Haven....soooooossssssssss.		I'd say fairly diverse patient wise - reflecting on St. Mary Hospital & Waterbury Hospital.	
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA	Washington	lots of young professionals, beautiful and clean, free museums, great food scene, lots of fun bars and always something to do, close to other major cities on east coast, liberal, fun. Easy and quick to get out of the city for hiking/more nature. Lots of great wineries surrounding the city in MD and VA.	housing is very expensive ... expect ~2k for a 1BR in most desirable neighborhoods, probably better than boston or nyc but worse than philly/baltimore< is renting a decent house out of the question? (out of the question, it costs $1200 to rent a bedroom in a Georgetown house. Most residents live in nearby Virginia or Maryland where apartments run $2200 for a one bedroom) . No one's mentioned traffic? (awful traffic, but to be expected in a busy city) lmao	georgetown area is not super accessible, but most major neighborhoods are connected by major metro stops/bus systems; people in DC always complain about WMATA being dysfunctional/delayed/broken, but when you compare it to most other places in the US ... it's pretty good. (ismetroonfire.com cracks me up all the time. Gotta love WMATA) buses are underrated and great, there are so many of them and they make up for parts of the city where the metro doesnt go	super hot and humid in the summer, but winters are pretty mild	PLENTIFUL lots of young single people in DC. -Check out "overhearddistrict" on Instagram to get an idea of the kinds of people who live in D.C.	Plenty of representation, fantastic LGBTQ crew and dating scene. Multiple bars/clubs catering to the LGBTQ crowd.	Very much so! It's home to all of the embassies so very, very diverse.	
FLORIDA	Fort Lauderdale	Beach, Diversity, cheap major airport in city		Must have a car. There's public transportation available but not great.	Top notch	A-	Very friendly towards LGBTQ people. Wilton Manors is close to downtown Ft. Lauderdale and it's a famous gay city.	It's very diverse.	
FLORIDA	Gainesville	Lots of food options x2<<Eh very much disagree, mostly college scene food typa stuff as this place is the definition of a college town. <--The food is good--Depends what you are into, if you like nature walks, beautiful springs, proximity to beaches and big cities, and a "small town feel" but not rural per se, then you would like it. But def not a Miami, Tampa type vibes---Nature is great around Gainesville	Mostly a college town. Closest major airport would be Jacksonville or Orlando.<< Outside of Gainesville it can get rural pretty quick but your never too far from a large city.	Since it's a college town, there is very good public transit. The RTS (local bus system) is very organized	Mild winters, VERY humid and hot in the summer. Best time of the year are the winters, beatuiful weather, doesnt rain much, can still go to outdoorsy things	Mostly college town so pretty poor <- disagreed, plenty of people in the dating scene since college town<--also disagree given its a large public university theres plenty of people	Supportive	I would say overall lacking.	
FLORIDA	Jacksonville	It's the biggest continental city in the US so you'll have all types of scenarios. South of Beach Blvd is the part with better apartments and things to do (especially near St Johns Town Center), it's a beautiful city with everything you need. Everything is 10-15 minutes away (including the beach) because you can drive through Butler blvd, Beach Blvd, etc. The city where majority of doctors (attendings or residents with families) live is actually Ponte Vedra, a city with mansions and some of the best schools in the country.	GF and I just visited and it was reallllly rundown and ghetto. Like tons of homelessness in the city and even around the hospital. Felt unsafe walking in a lot of areas. < Probably you didn't visit the nice spots < went to avondale, san marco, and riverside lol // Riverside and avondale are nice! Old, but nice. Just stay east of 17 and south of !-10, the further north or west you go, the worse it gets. Five points area is cool too	Useless	Excellent. It's warm, but not as much as Orlando or Miami. Even have some quite cold days during winter.				
FLORIDA	Lakeland	Very surprised about this town. Fastest growing county in ALL of Florida. 30 min drive to both Tampa and Orlando. Low cost of living. Has a little bit of everything, cute city.	It's becoming more popular and lots of development going on.	No	Excellent. Hurricanes never make it strong to Central Florida.	Plenty of college and universities around, night life is also quite active in Downtown Lakeland.	Supportive.	It's Florida, has it all.	One of the safest cities in the Nation.
FLORIDA	Miami	South Beach, Diversity; unrivalled sex clubs+1; weather is amazing, always 10-20 minutes from beach; great art scene w/ wynwood and art basel; FL has no income tax; large melting pot w/ people from all over: largest being latin america and caribbean, but also russia/europe, all over the states (especially ny transplants); international airport that is 15-20 minutes away and accessible by public transit that can literally fly you anywhere in the world	Food scene is lacking other than top notch Caribbean/South&Central American; hurricane season though they can actually be fun assuming they arent over a 3. Hurricane partys were really fun pre-covid; doesn't respond well to a pandemic; high cost of living; there is a large crowd of people w/ a certain level of plasticity; traffic can be bad < The only Cons that I see after living here for 1 year is the cost, its a super expensive city! << will say essentially NEED to speak spanish around here to the point where bars/clubs play more non-english songs. need to speak spanish to be able to care for a majority of your patients	Lmao yeah right. Metrorail goes through UM/Jackson campus and downtown/Brickell. But that's it	Gorgeous	Great, a lot of beautiful people. Latinx men & women main population. Black men/women also make up the 2nd largest demographic for Miami. The non-Hispanic caucasians are more-so in the suburbs or Broward. Its summer 10 months out of the year so a lot of people make a serious effort to look good and dress well. Be warned: dating in Miami can be kinda $$$, depending on your tastes. Befriend a homegrown local who can show you the cheaper, but still amazing, spots. Note: Miami-Hispanics are often very conservative and the majority love Trump. So if you're into that, then you'll love it here. <majority love trump and biden won miami dade county. <-- LOL so true about how miami hispanics are incrediby conservative in their values (i can say this since i am one, tho not politically) , love to shoot guns and hunt, ride ATVs, protest abortion etc hahaha, why even for dating you have to bring up politics... . Its just ridiculous. << are you dumb? do you understand how statistics work? one group can have a majority choice for one party but the entire population can vote the other way. also, if i'm dating someone who potentially might raise children with me then I'm obviously going to make sure that we have similar values we will teach our children	Very supportive in the Miami-Beach area, overall i think city is fine with it but some Hispanic populations will be more "i don't care but don't shove it in my face"	Extremely Diverse, one of the most diverse cities in the country. Hispanics from Central and South America as well as well-represented by the Caribbean islands, most notably, of course, Cuba	
FLORIDA	Orlando	Every tourist attraction you can imagine and some you can't. Very large with lots to do. COL is okay given salary. Major airprots and can get all around florida as all roads lead to Orlando. >> 1-2hr drive to the beach (clearwater on the west, cocoa beach to the east to name a few) if you avoid high traffic hours, amazing hispanic food	Need a car for sure, public transit is god awful. Lots of toll roads. Insane aggressive drivers locally and tons of tourists who have no idea what they are doing/where they are going. Construction is always going on. Rent has gotten expensive over the past 4 years ($1200 -> $1900 for the same apartment)	HA	Sunshine state baby >> humid AF (understandably)	Bad			
FLORIDA	Pensacola	Reasonable cost of living, lively downtown scene on the weekends, the beaches are beautiful, arguably the most beautiful in Florida!	Not much to do other than the beach. Mostly a very far right leaning community politically (i.e. this is the county that continues to vote for Matt Gaetz)	Poor	Hot and humid during the summer, fall and spring are nice in the 50-70's, mostly mild winters but we get snow and ice occasionally	Not great. A LOT of military members if that's your thing (Navy base in town)			
FLORIDA	Tampa	Close To Beaches, lots to do, tons of food options and brews/bars/pubs. Ever changing always growing. Close to St. Pete which is a gem of a city	Commute is terrible. *not really, just depends on if there are events* As a tampa native traffic is bad but not when compared to Miami, Orlando, etc. As the city grows the need for new roads becomes more apparent. The COL is increasing and housing exploded but the program salary has increased a bit but its still pretty expensive to live in tampa proper. *even with the salary increase most residents I know are living with roommates to ease COL, if you're willing to extend your commute or live somewhere not very nice you can afford to live alone.	Not that good * as a native its god awful EXCEPT the downtown trolley, that shit is FREE and fire, gets you from the convention center to Ybor city passing Amelie Arena (lightning games), the aquariam and sparkman's wharf (nice outdoor fooderies and biergarten)	Always Spring, Summer, god awful heat	Great Dating scene for 21-30 *Lol absolutely not true, there's plenty of young adults around but everyone I know on the dating scene here has not been very successful and hates it. Lots of conservative folks in the area if that's important to you one way or the other.	Great amount of LGBTQ+, St. Pete across the bay has the largest pride parade outside of SF.	Hispanic, asian, eastern european, black, middle eastern, we have all kinds of folk. Vast majority are white	
GEORGIA	Athens								
GEORGIA	Atlanta	Diverse city with lots to do (the Beltline, Ponce/Krog markets, Piedmont park, sporting events, museums, etc.), very affordable for city of its size, not too far from hiking and other outdoor activities, weather. Great food, lots of sports, big SEC city, lots of pups in the city (Piedmont park has great dog parks). Best places to live: Highlands, Inman Park, Midtown, Buckhead	Traffic (really bad, people drive like lunatics, there's always multiple accidents on every highway), very spread out city with lots of neighborhood pockets, public transportation does not cover a lot of the city. Would need to lease/buy a car. +2 rent prices increasing even in surrounding metro.	MARTA is not SMARTA...  But for real, the 'metro' can get you around, but it's kind of crappy. Best use is to get to the airport.	Summer is hot but bearable, rest of the year is ok, doesn't get too cold in the winter    Beware of pollen. Don't get a white car. You'll end up with a yellow car by the end of the day.	B	B+ < details? +1	A+	
GEORGIA	Augusta	Masters take place here, medium size city that is growing at a steady pace. Excellent quality of life and super affordable. Residents are able to buy houses since their first year. Family friendly	No a good area for nightlife or single people.	No, traffic is non-existant, you need a car but public transportation is growing	Hot and humid. Summers are intense, winter and fall stay pretty nice	C+	B+	B+	
GEORGIA	Chattanooga	Beautiful geography, excellent opportunities for outdoorsy people, low COL, driving access to several large cities, great place to raise a family, plenty of places to drink/eat with several cool bars which includes rooftop bars (proportion to city size), easy commute from suburbs for hospital hours (rush is 730-8am & 430-5pm)	Relatively small city with tiny airport (many people find it more worthwhile to drive to Atlanta for a direct flight). Overall education level of the population is lower than other metro areas I've experienced.	Not great, driving is necessary for navigating the city.	Summers are hot/humid, spring and fall are beautiful. Winters are dark and dreary but realtively mild (20F is usually as low as it gets).	Eh..	C		
GEORGIA	Columbus	Wonderful arts and culture scene, especially downtown. Tons of great restaurants, parks, trails, hiking. Close to Atl for the big airport and quick day trips							
GEORGIA	Macon	!!!				terrible		A	i've never felt unsafe but its definitely not safe.
HAWAII	Honolulu	It's Hawaii	Expensive af, traffic	Overall good <<public transportation is not efficient in Hawaii lol	Tropical	Urban setting, you will find someone <<< how does being in an island setting affect dating?	LGBTQ friendly	Heavy Asian/Pacific Islander population	
ILLINOIS	Berwyn								
ILLINOIS	Chicago	Diverse city with great dating options. Lots of amazing resturants/bars/coffee shops, and many things to do (museums/art galleries/beach/concerts/sport games), tons of lakeside greenspace for biking/walking. High number of great academic and community programs so there's definitely a medical/academic community. <<+1, personally think that Chicago is one of the best places to move as a young broke resident looking for a new city while having fun doing stuff.     Way better COL than other major cities, while still getting the city vibe (eg, same cost for apartment would give you in unit laundry in a renovated space vs. a sketchy part of the neighborhood with communal laundry in a big city). Don't necessarily need a car to get around, and Zipcar is easy to get if you want to trek out for nature or IKEA or something. Tied with SoCal (Irvine/LA) for best place to live in if you're into League of Legends. Very low ping since the servers are based in Chicago	Traffic during peak times, weather can be rough if you've never been around cold winters (but in my opinion it's not that bad), City living in every sense of the word, so not much "outdoor" activities, if that's your thing. (Disagree +3 - also live here and there's tons of green space and parks everywhere) (Agree in terms of hiking or mountain activities). Can be sketchy during the dark, don't be stupid. Still the Midwest.	great public transportation system; arguably the best in the country but only if you want to get downtown, v difficult to go from outer neighborhood to outer neighborhood (wheels on a spoke system) << To whoever said that Chicago has the best public transport system, NYC would like to have a word+2. They also must not live in Hyde Park... << Also if you move here, recommend NOT using the subway at night and if you have to the buses tend to be a lot safer/cleaner.	windy garbage. can't feel face in winter. even worse when you have to walk everywhere and wait outside for buses/trains (owning a car is very expensive). summer is amazing and unbeatable.	Pretty great for all races imo. Compared to other midwest cities, everyone isn't married by 26.	Wonderful	Very (unless you are by northwestern), plenty of historical neighborhoods to explore << Even then, not bad.	people are pretty paranoid about shootings and robberies here, but in my experience this is rare around hospitals or on busy weekends, beware fearmongering by suburbanites who have never actually walked the streets of Chicago themselves at night +1 // been out and about many late nights downtown, never had issues, use your common sense - ideally be with people and be aware of surroundings and you'll never have any issues
ILLINOIS	Peoria	Lots of coffee shops and breweries, some live music, nice farmers market in the summer. Pretty river front. Very cheap COL (11th cheapest place to live pre USWN) and "87 best place to live in the US"	Very little to do. kind of more a giant suburb than urban. Lots of poverty, very red. Pretty much all of the community's money is coming from a company that is slowly moving out.     Difficult to find a trusty wax parlor, I was rocking a bush first few months of intern year <- just get a mens beard trimmer and use the 5mm guard <<its not the same lol	None	Nice during the summer, coooold winters	Bad lol. People make do though I guess.	One gay bar <<ayyyy	One of the most segregated cities in the country, and ranked 7th worst place for black people to live <<NOT TRUE, we're #5 now lmao	
ILLINOIS	Rockford		Not a lot to do. Non-existent dating. Downtown area (or anyting west of Rock River) is not safe.						
ILLINOIS	Urbana-Champaign								
INDIANA	Fort Wayne	Near world class entertainment, food scene is amazing, near major cities for easy quick getaway whenever you want, COL is low comparable to California, sports are up and coming	Rent is getting expensive around downtown. Lots of bachelorette partiers and drunk people on weekend nights. Traffic around rush hours around med centers/people here drive terribly. Definitely feels like a small city if you come from large coastal places. <IMO rent is too high everywhere. Becoming more diverse but still not diverse enough IMO. Patient population is from a much larger catchment area and is not diverse.	"Bus system is ok. Can get you most places in the city. best to have a car.    Certain places you can walk to the hospital or within city depending on your neighborhood (and if you like hills)"	Is it really as bad as everyone says it is? <unfortunately yes < Not at all, February is the coldest, otherwise like everyother location, you get used to cold and learn to adapt. 50 degrees could be cold to some, warm to others, get wool socks and down coat. < I don't think anyone would agree the cold there is subjective lol < Yes, this is bullshit lol. The weather is ass from November to May. April is cold and windy and with minimal sunsine. Summers can be hot and humid. There is only a couple of months of the year where I would classify the weather as good.	Lol + 10 < Dating scene is more favorable to men vs women as more women in the population and not enough guys	Not a chance	Not the most Diverse area but A good mix of a white and black population with some refugees from Africa, Middle East, south east Asia.	
INDIANA	Indianapolis	relaitvely low COL, Ikea :) > Outdoor parks and Rec areas around the city. Seconding the lower cost of living.	midwest weather, poor night life, limited outdoor activities, bad for non-white folks	Very limited public transport.	Pretty standard for Midwest. Cold winters but minimal snow. Warm/hot summers	lol	lol // there are pockets of progressive cities like Broad Ripple, Fountain Square, and hubs like Mass Ave with some ok gay bars // Indy is overall fine, but the rest of Indiana.....	more diversity than you'd think (59% white, 29% black/AA, 10% hispanic/latinx, ~3% asian). Really large immigrant populations (specifically from Myanmer, Honduras, and Nigeria) // the largest burmese community in the country. Few large international grocery chains to get the basics	
IOWA	Des Moines	typical midwest town- pretty easy to get around w/little to no traffic, low COL. pretty decent food options (hispanic incl mexican, ecuadorian, cuban, also viet, thai, etc). really nice farmers market in the summer months. West des moines is pretty upscale with a nice mall, Costco, supertarget, higher end restuarants, etc. pretty suburban.	cold if you're not used to that, no huge body of water, not super walkable unless you live downtown so you'll likely need a car	bus system but not sure how good it is	cold in the winter << & can be hot/humid in the summer	not sure, a bit of a bar scene, but not huge.		75% white, 11% AA, 12% Hispanic, 4% Asian	
IOWA	Iowa City	Opinions please?? << people are nice I guess, they love the concept of "Iowa nice", but as a west coast native, they seem like normal ppl who are just a little too friendly to me. People LOVE football and tailgating in Iowa City, so if that's your thing, great... if not, get out of town for every home game bc it gets incredibly annoying. Rent isn't outrageous. Never any traffic. There is a target, trader joes, and costco. >> some great little restaraunts, feels small town but has a lot of shopping,etc. If you bike there are tons of trails for that. Outdoor rock climbing a short(ish) drive away. When the undergrads leave for the summer the town feels very chill/quiet if you like that.	Nothing to do in the winter (and winter lasts from october - may). Obession with college football. Not a ton to do in the summer either and it gets incredibly hot and humid. >> college town, the undergrads can be a bit annoying on weekend nights if you're walking around.		Awful. Winters are very cold (high of 20 on a good day), dry, and very long (oct - may). Summers are hot and humid, 90+ degrees.	not great, mostly college students on the apps, bars are full of them too (pre-COVID... but honestly probably during COVID too)	friendly, but still needs work. >> there's a gay bar, skews liberal because it's a college town, I know of queer grad students having success on dating apps. Pride parade/events in the summer, and all the neighboring cities (Des Moines, Quad Cities, etc) have pride celebrations too.	by far mostly white, small refugee population and some migrant farm workers from latin america. >> If you're Native there are Natives here, just not a lot of us. There is a Native student group at the university (undergrads and grad students), so definitely get involved with that as a starting point. There's a big pow wow every year and a reservation not far that also has a casino and pow wows.	
KANSAS	Kansas City	decent bar scene, lots of local restaurants with good food, great sport scene if you like NFL or baseball. <<Slightly cheaper COL compared to MO side. Very nice, safe suburbs and good schools about 30 minutes out	horrible drivers who will side swipe your car and yeet. not the safest city. racial tension here is strong af	bus - bad, street car - good, and is being expanded!	mild winters and mild summers	dating is yikessss city here, esp for people of color.	there are a lot of pride flags but im told the dating pool is small from friends (take this opinion w/ a grain of salt bc this is not first hand experience im just trying to help lol)	horrible and the city is literally segregated down Troost Ave. constant microaggressions. Supprisingly huge latinx population, you will learn spanish on accident if you don't know it yet, huge plus.	Stats wise, pretty bad. I've felt safe mostly. Lots of shooting and gang violence my first 3 years here, has seemed to slow down drastically since 2020
KANSAS	Wichita	Low COL, family friendly, kind midwest vibe, nice new airport, decent culture of independent restaurants/bars - Old Town is pretty cool, slower pace of life (could be con depending on your lifestyle)	A bit isolated from other cities (OKC, KC). No ocean or mountains nearby, Denver is a 7hr drive.	You definitely need a car	humid, hot summers, 4 seasons				
KENTUCKY	Knoxville	CIty with hometown feel, great food. Close to bigger cities for weekend trips. Great hiking. Really nice weather with no severe storms. plenty of bars. lots of college students. cheap livinng							
KENTUCKY	Lexington	Lexington is a hidden gem. It's a medium sized city with plenty to do (restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, UK sports). Safe and ridiculously affordable.	Crime rate rising - stats per capita for murder rate higher than NYC- stay away from some dangerous areas and you'll be totally fine. Mostly gang related violence/crime -- pretty much like any small city. When looking for housing use websites like neighborhoodscouts to show crime maps and avoid those areas.		All 4 seasons, very mild winter with little snow.			More diverse than you would think for KY because it's a university city.	
KENTUCKY	Louisville	Smaller city with a mid sized city feel. Lots of breweries and bourbon distilleries if that's your thing, AMAZING local food scene, plenty of things to do. Great public parks for running, I've heard there are good hiking spots within a short drive. Lots of surrounding suburbs that function basically like their own little city. Actually has a great cost of living, especially the further you get from downtown. Three parks designed by Olmsted. Bernheim forest and Jefferson are two parks with hiking trails that are within 25-30 minutes driving.	Living in certain parts of downtown not super safe (mainly the west). The traffic can be bad during rush hour due to the convoluted interstate system (traffic is not bad if you are comparing to New York, LA). Pretty much 100% of people suffer from terrible ohio river valley allergies.	Students and residents can ride the TARC (transit authority of river city) buses for free with ID, although I don't know much about it since it's easy to own/lease a car and drive everywhere you need to go	Has 4 distinct seasons: hot, humid summer, really nice fall weather that lasts ~2 months, winters can get cold and it snows a decent amount, spring=allergies. I feel like we get a lot of overcast days being so close to the Ohio river.	Pretty good dating scene; a lot of younger people moving to the area.	I feel like the LGBTQ+ scene is great here and very well-supported, especially compared to the rest of the state< The School of Medicine has an LGBTQ+ curriculum		
LOUISIANA	Baton Rouge	The young population has been growing in the last few years. More and more restaurants are popping up. Very affordable COL. Only about an hour from baddies in New Orleans.	This city has the worst infrastructure in the entire country. Traffic is awful during rush hour. Not much to do in terms of nature, have to drive about an hour north for okay hiking trails. It also rains 90% of the time during the summer and of course hurricanes are a possiblity. < Terrible city, nothing to do except drive to NOLA.	There's a bus system but it's very suboptimal. Would not recommend relying on it.	Hot, humid, rainy summers with mild winters; no real fall or spring	Actually pretty decent	Also pretty decent given the size of the city and the fact that it's in the deep south	Not really; neighbborhoods are kinda segregated	
LOUISIANA	Lafayette						pretty good		
LOUISIANA	New Orleans	Amaxzing cety, alwiz somthng to doo on tyme off, grate culchr. Peopl hav the most incrdble, wld storys. Ladiez are assed up frm the calves up.    Incrdb food- mostly Suthr styl or Vietnamese! NOLA wl alwiz surpryz yoo (for gud or bad) and the sens of commnity is incrdbly strong. Nebrs luk owt for ech othr, pepl celebrat togethr for eny litl reasn. Mard Gras is actuly a (famly frendly) munths long afr of paradz and celebrashns. Mny othr fun festvls thruowt the yer. mnmnl traffc/nothng is furthr than a 15-20 mn drve. Peopl luv smal bussnss/shoppng locl and luv supprting ech othr - 10/10 recommd. Relatvly lbral but stl the Suth. Grat cety asde frm werd comnts about assed up ladys. publc trnsit is somwhat lackng.	Car might flood - secoond that - thirdd, thiss can happen during moderate rainstorms. Look for housing in areas thatt dont flood, if possible. Somee neighborhooods can be danggerous - it iss still a city and you mustt pay attentionn to your surroundinngs.  Roads are absolutelly terrible, very bad driverrs, high car insurannce cost. inffrastructure in generall not the best. Cityy shuts down during Mardi Graas.  Lived in city for 4 yeaars - roads suck, bringg an SUV. Flooding will happpen, especially in Mid Citty which iss close to the Hospittals and cheap enough to rent a house. I like Midd City if you wantt to live in New Orleans, otherwisee look at living in Metairiee whichh is like 2 exitss away on the 10.	Bad. Most people have cars, some can get by with a bicycle.	Hot, humid, rain, never snow	Most people you meet grew up here but there are also plenty of transplants from around the country. Most young professionals are in the medical field or lawyers.	Great!! Super welcoming		Not a safe city, had drive by shoots 1 block from my hosue. If you follow nola.com you will see crime sprees going on in the city, teenage boys driving around with guns and raping people. https://fox17.com/news/nation-world/man-charged-with-kidnapping-raping-couple-after-new-orleans-shooting This guy also shot a Tulane med stuent.
LOUISIANA	Shreveport	None <- LOL this whole row	Everything. Small town. Very unsafe. Cars are regularly broken into. Even hospital parking lots are unsafe. Roads are terrible. Food is okay. COL has gone up this past year. Apartment rents skyrocketed. Flights are more expensive from here and no international flights. There's trash everywhere. Not many restuarants. Homelessness seems to be increasing. They need to put ads on the TV soliciting donations for the people of shreveport. It's so ass out here. I would donate money to the people of Shreveport so they can get a bus ticket and leave this hellhole	There is a bus system, but poorly maintained and low-frequency. Don't count on it. Must have a car. Traffic can be surprisingly bad especially around Youree Drive, the bridges across the Red River, and in Bossier.	It sucks. Hot and oppressively humid during the summer. Winters are mild but still humid. Never really snows, but expect a few ice storms in the winter that shut down the city.	Dismal	Not a chance    Overall a very evangelical city. You probably won't get attacked or anything but you may be judged if you are openly LGBT.	LOL	Crime is concentrated in the poorest areas of the city, but the poverty rate in the city is pretty high so those areas are more common than most cities.
MAINE	Portland	pleasant, charming city, incredible craft beer scene, Arts district has lots of nice restaurants. Beaches in the summer, skiing in the winter, beautiful running trails to get that fresh Maine air, very environmentally conscious city, low key, very dog/family friendly, safe.	minimal diversity, must be able to tolerate or enjoy deeze nuts, small. Minimal nightlife/laughable "club" scene - better for those who'd want a craft beer at 10pm and in bed by 12<even 10 is a stretch at times to get a beer. Most things close pretty early. This whole hippie culture goes way too far. I know way too many people who just straight up dont beleive in science. Yeah, sure, the "vibes" will prevent your kids from getting measles 🤦🏽‍♀️	bus system but you definitely need a car (ideally with 4 wheel drive). If you live on the peninsula, most things are walkable.	^similar to Madison description above excpet less windchill	small city so small dating pool - you'll inevitably see people you recognize out and about	very liberal city, however also very small		
MARYLAND	Baltimore	Lots of young people, a city of neighborhoods that each has a different feel so you can easily find your niche whether it be quirky or calm or fun-loving. DC is close (can drive or take the $8 train) and so is Philly. COL is pretty cheap considering you have the amenities of a city (being able to walk to restaurants, *breweries*, coffee shops, grocery store) but be able to have luxuries of living close to the waterfront. The festivals and farmers markets are pretty cool and unique too (ie Hon festival, Artscape, Light City). BWI is super cheap to fly out of even cross country. And just because DC is above Baltimore on this spreadsheet: https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/baltimore-insider/bal-100-reasons-why-baltimore-is-better-than-dc-pictures-20130809-photogallery.html < most of these are dumb AF <Food scene is VERY good for a medium sized city, short drive to suburbs will get you even more food options	It's not the Wire but it still has its safety issues so don't leave items visible in car or walk with headphones. Changes block by block. Some parts of the city are safer than others so definitely visit and walk around the area you intend to move to if you decide to live here. Public school system in the city is not as good as the county (no heat...). < city is improving, but there are still blocks of abandoned homes that look like they had just been bombed < Please take safety seriously if you are strongly considering Baltimore. This is a GREAT place for underserved medicine but just be very conservative after dark (basic stuff like drive/uber instead of walking long distances alone at night, stay in popular places) and you will be fine. If you don't want to deal with the safety issues at all, the suburbs are a 20-30min drive to work and extremely safe (very family friendly and cheap!).	Free circulator shuttle that is often late. Not great public transportation. Basically nobody uses public transport because its easy to drive/walk to work- also safety issues after dark. call it on an app.	Hot and humid in summer, milder winters (really only Dec-Feb/Mar). // Less humid than DC lol	Lots of recent grads (similar to DC) but cheaper (: < dating scene is mostly online, but if you like going to pubs or joining sports leagues during non-winter months you will be fine (volleyball, soccer)	Solid? Check out the Mt. Vernon area neighborhood, and Hampden. // Know of at least couple gay bars/clubs in Mt Vernon. Baltimore Pride is a big deal locally. Lot of LGBTQ history in the city. LGBTQ flags are displayed at a lot of shops/restaurants	Yes. < overwhelmingly african american, large SES diversity but limited hispanic/asian population here (Hopkins almost has a monopoly over the Spanish speaking patients) < I disagree there is a LARGE spanish-speaking population. City is very diverse but also somewhat segregated. You walk into most restaurants in Fells', Fed Hill, or Mt Vernon, you will only see a minority of black people. <suburbs (Towson, Columbia etc) are way more diverse than you probably think and actually very integrated	Not safe at all; Even in nice neighborhoods like Upper Fells, I've been mugged at gunpoint multiple times (once walking from my parked car to my house); window of car also has been smashed multiple times so I would recommend living close to the harbor at one of the nice luxury apartments on the waterfront that provides parking
MASSACHUSETTS	Boston	On the agua, easily una ciudad walkable y a más segura at that. A paradise para runners. Tons of top escuelas y programas around the área with a big escena de citas. Snow is handled bien. Something is happening para all seasons. Great escena de alcohol. Escena de comida is good if tienes un carro to drive to los pockets con food gems that el sistema de metro cannot reach (es decir, if you are sick of comida china in Chinatown, there is mejor comida asiática in Malden/Quincy IMO). Parts de Boston always seem to be growing/building something new (West End with the Hub, Cambridge, Allston). Easy to access el mejor skiing en el northeast (vs NYC) y tons of montañas para hiking just a drive north or west. Playas outside el Boston proper are muy accesibles if you don't want to access los like Revere Beach via el sistema de metro. The North End tiene some de los mejores Italian gems (On par y algunos dishes mejor than NYC) but I find los Italian joints that utilizan seafood have the most éxito. Tends to be más liberal leaning than la mayoría de Massachusetts y significantly más liberal than el northeast cities (with la excepción de NYC) - I have only maybe had a handful de trump supporting patients at my hospital. While pockets de communities are segregated, Boston still seems más diverse than lo que gets credit for.	Expensive vivienda is the biggest downside but I believe la mayoría de los programas compensate for this. Weather if you don't like cold temperatura will be un problema. As a POC, I don't feel like I have been discriminado against compared to otras big ciudades in America despite algunos parts de Boston being segregados (ie Beacon hill siendo white, Chinatown siendo Asian obv, Dorchester siendo black, y East Boston siendo LatinX), but I think con all of the Boston programas combined, hay only a handful de black residents en los programas so there is that. A running chiste is that if you're allergic to shellfish tendrás problemas aquí but getting ciertos tipos de food (ie amazing pho) will require un longer ride en el subway or a carro to get to esos lugares instead of walking fuera for 5 minutos. / the costo de a studio or 1BR is probably on par con NYC ($2k estudio hacia arriba), BUT estos lugares have more espacio y al menos in unit laundry, central AC, newly built - so you're pagando for mejor, even if el mínimo out of pocket is el mismo. Things en Boston también close super early, difícil to find muchos food lugares open past 9-10PM. Nightlife is pretty malo for un big ciudad too as bars close pretty early. Perspective como alguien who moved from Chicago to Boston for residencia: más expensive rent, peor comida (very bland y pricey), extremely liberal politics (I'm moderate y usually vote blue, and this was still un huge shellshock for me), residential buildings son generally old (in-unit AC / laundry aren't guaranteed even with 2.5K/month rent). I absolutely adore mi programa but will be seeking to move elsewhere for fellowship. Mi spouse who vivió en NYC, Boston, y Chicago: ""Boston is all el gasto de NYC without any de los beneficios"" and eso resonates. << ++ to most de esto, Boston cuesta tanto como larger ciudades con un way worse food y nightlife scene <+1. \\Yelp did a study comparing Asian food in big cities and Boston ranked dead last. If you think the pho is good here, i feel sorry for you	Yes - mejor than I pensé it would be. // until you get stuck en the Línea Roja for 2 horas underground. But it's a lot mejor than most ciudades in the US TBH < siempre y cuando tu tren de la Línea Naranja doesn't get set on fire	Summers son increíbles, Spring/Fall is increíble (Boston Common y Boston Public Garden son impresionantes durante este tiempo). Winter is frío, but if you are into snow y snow sports, it can be divertido.	Plentiful	Obvi<< Can someone elaborate on this? Particularly about soical scene here. I imagine maybe decent dating pool given all the univerisities/gradstudents/residents but do personas go out? << Sizable dating pool with muchos colleges/universities. A numero of well-established LGBTQ facing bars/clubs    B+ on a good day, but really a B	Pretty sólido, given todas las universidades, la ciencia / la industria tecnológica en la área. Less diverso que maybe NYC. Boston does have una historia de racismo / segregación, y los barrios remain pretty segregados. I've vivido en both NYC y Boston, y diría que if I'm going to a bar in Boston, hay una mucha mayor probabilidad de que me sienta un poco más incómodo que en NYC (as a POC), y you may see más gente con American flag t-shirts, if you catch mi drift << esto depende del área de la ciudad / tipo de bar al que vayas though, y generalmente puedes adivinar cuáles lugares son less diversos / more conservative que la norma. Decent latino population too i guess	Very safe
MASSACHUSETTS	Springfield	affordable, lots of free or cheap things to do, great enormous park, diversity of food options, no traffic, overall an easy place to live						Large Hispanic population	Worst crime in New England, as it's more like a Rust Belt city, but not terrible
MASSACHUSETTS	Worcester	Cheap-ish cost of living. Nice (but pricy) suburbs with great public schools if you're trying to set down roots. 1 hour drive from Boston with somewhat easy access to beaches and mountains. Small but growing list of fun resturants and bars.	Wish there were more things to do, though this is growing. While there is an airport in the city, flights are few. Will likely have to head out to Boston to make the most of social scene. Umass says theyre 45 minutes from boston but it's definitely more like an hour without traffic, likely more with boston's horrible traffic. Overall its not a great place, but there are definitely worse spots to be.	Bus routes. Not great. Would recommend a car.	Classic New England - see Boston. Spring - Fall are great. Winter to early spring are cold and wet.	A relatively small dating pool. While there are universities, it skews towards undergrads with smaller numbers of graduate students. Limited number of working professionals in the area as more jobs are in Boston.	meh	Ok	
MICHIGAN	Ann Arbor	Really easy to live in, with lots of green space and tons of trails/parks for running, walking, dog-parking, etc. There's a little downtown with some decent places to eat, though won't knock your socks off by any means. Pre-COVID, there was always something going on related to the university to keep things interesting: shows, concerts, speakers, and obviously sports. Michigan as a whole is also gorgeous-- lots of fantastic state parks within 30 minutes of Ann Arbor, and some fabulous Great Lakes weekend trips around the mitten. Detroit is just 40 min away if you want a bigger city feel. People truly love this university and end up falling in love with Ann Arbor oftentimes.	If you're coming from a major big city, it's definitely a step down. I think AA is one of the best college towns in the country with a lot of diverse food options and a good amount of things to do, but at the end of the day it is a college town. Not everyone's vibe.	Most people either live within walking distance of the hospital or drive. There is a unversity bus system that's pretty good, though.	The winter leaves something to be desired: it's quite, quite grey from December through the beginning of April, and pretty cold-- though not as bitter cold as other midwest places (Jan average has been low 30s). However, the summers are unbeatable. Perfect temperature (warm but not blistering or humid), with loads of lakes and parks to enjoy. Fall and spring are also gorgeous.	Probably B-tier, given that Ann Arbor is anchored by the University of Michigan and you're within 40 minutes from downtown Detroit. Lots of people who go to UM also settle in Ann Arbor after residency.	Very liberal city. Good gay bar with solid brunch. Plenty of same-sex parents	Ann Arbor itself is not diverse. Michigan Medicine has a massive catchment area, though, so you get folks from all over the state and surrounding area and capture much more diversity than Ann Arbor has alone.	Can't believe Ann Arbor is getting this much criticism. I love Ann Arbor, it's a great city. Intelligent population, everyone is kind, a lot of good high end to hole in the wall delicious restaurants. Gorgeous in the summer! Winter is hard but it's hard in literally any northern city. Toughen up! // Never had any safety concerns in Ann Arbor, from living there for 5+ years.
MICHIGAN	Detroit	Outstanding experience coming from LA. I thought it would be way worse but I honestly think the city has done a 360 or people have just been lying about it. Reminds of Philly in that there's green space you can find if you drive for 4 minutes outside the city. The people are extremely friendly, the downtown is iconic, lake front is beautiful, plenty of outdoor activities, the suburbs are not too far and have some of the richest per capita counties in the nation. There are also tons of less well off people but honestly it's been super safe and the city police have pretty much demolished any gang presence. Amazon/Whole foods have made a significant impact, there's tons of new businesses popping up downtown, the universities are definitely on the upswing (Wayne State, Oakland) and the suburbs house some of the top schools in the nation. Honestly, this is what LA used to be when I was a kid... <<what fucking alternative universe detroit has your dumbass been living in?	Not as diverse as some of the other west coast cities, burning hot summers > Summers are pretty nice, tbh. Winters are probably similar to Chicago/Milwaukee. It's typical Midwest weather through-and-through	- Traditional bus network  - People Mover (elevated downtown circulator)  - Q line light rail (through downtown and midtown)  - Limited suburb bus connections  - Amtrak connection to Chicago on Wolverine service    Built environment for multi-modal transportation is slowly decreasing the car-centric design of the past century with road diets, bicycling infrastructure, land use policy, etc. Definitely have a long way to go - this is the hub for the American automotive industry, afterall. Currently a bridge and tunnel (both tolled) connecting to Windsor Canada.	Not the best, better than Minnesota, Cleveland, worse than Cali obv. >Typical Midwest weather on-par with Chicago and Milwaukee.	Much better than I would have thought. x2. Dating in Metro Detroit was very nice, even as an Asian guy.	Very tolerant	Large african american population with huge arab/bengali population. There's also a reasonable latino population. In the suburbs there are mostly white collar whites. Large Middle Eastern population nearby (Dearborn). Small pockets of Asians in Oakland County (Troy, Madison Heights)	Like most cities but with higher rates of crime, although most violent crime is targeted and property crime opportunistic. As an average citizen I do not worry too much about violent crime, but stay aware of my surroundings. Practice city precautions (e.g., don't hang out in seedy areas based on your guts) and you should be fine.
MICHIGAN	Kalamazoo	small city with surrounding rural areas, 1 hr from Lake Michigan and Grand Rapids, 1.5 hrs from Ann Arbor, 2 hrs from Detroit and Chicago, lots of good food and beer, many outdoor activities	very conservative rural areas, more suburban (people from larger cities often complain about being bored here but I haven't had that issue)	not reliable at all	all 4 seasons, some lake effect snow but not as bad as other areas of the state	college town, probably not the best	downtown is okay, surrounding areas can be quite conservative	fairly white, decent sized black and African immigrant population downtown, small Mexican population in surrounding areas	
MINNESOTA	Minneapolis	Lots of park during summer; good food options; relatively liberal (can be pro or con i guess); great outdoor walking/running space; 2nd most bike friendly city in the US. More affordable than other cities (like Denver). Very little traffic, suburbs are only like 15 minutes away if you want to buy a house and commute.	Harsh weather( snow,cold-norm), absolutely not walkable (need car); high (mostly petty) crime rates, can be tough to break into the Midwest social scene since people stay here forever and hang out with their HS friends +2 Very complex patient population	Transportation Exists but sucks/can be dangerous. Most things aren't on the train lines and therefore dificult to get to without mutliple exchanges + walking in between. The buses are good but they're buses (slow and overcrowded). if you move here you need a car.	Summers are nice but can be humid and get really hot. Winters are cold and snowy as fck. Fall is super short but actually super nice. Spring is short too. Think LONG COLD BRUTAL winter, short spring, decent sometimes HOT summer, short AF fall, repeat.	Pretty good dating scene. Lots of affordable date options and a big dating pool (lots of people move here for work, or came here for college and stayed).	Great LGBTIA+ community/support here and a very welcoming environment but it might be harder as LGBTQ POC >> my partner and I love the local LGBTQ community. Black Hart of St. Paul is a long-standing historical bar in St. Paul that feels like home to us when we walk in. Lots of visible queer femme couples there on weekend nights. Also, check out Girrrl Scout, an organization that puts on queer dance parties every month or two. They're a blast and its feel like heaven for us as a lesbian couple, but tickets tend to sell out before the event so you have to be on your shit. The vibe in the Twin Cities is incredibly queer positive and we feel safe with PDA in public, etc.	Pretty white but a substantial Black population (that is a combination of Black immigrants and Black Americans). The white folks tend to lean liberal but it is far from a perfect city (see George Floyd, Daunte Wright, Philando Castile). In my experience as a non-Black POC, people tend to socialize in racially segregated pockets. Because of interesting patient population (Hmong, Somali immigrants) you get exposed to more interesting cases than you might in Madison, for example >> If you're Native American/Alaska Native there's great Native community here.	Relatively high crime for a college town. Not great.
MINNESOTA	Rochester	World class toilet wine scene <<yeah and toilet-class world scene. idk if that made sense but what im trying to say is life in rochester aint great, "life in rochester aint great" +1 to that especially as someone who moves from a diverse, big tropical city you will not like it.	Is the weather really as bad as I hear?? < Yes. I interviewed here 4 years ago for med school and remember the cold to this day. <Also if you are from the coasts/bigger city the food scene is non-existent. < Residents ordered Taco Bell and Chipotle as their food options for happy hour dinner < M4 here, Food is really bad. There is one good chinese noodle place that has some authentic dishes and one good thai place (but still American thai, nothing like you can get in LA or other large cities). The rest is crap. The food in the St. Paul/Mn is also very limited and not worth the 1.5 hr drive. +1 If you are vegetarian there is hardly anything for you.	Have an intercampus shuttle that transports employees from st mary's campus to downtown campus, no need for public transportation as residents get free parking. City does have public transit but mostly under utilized due to lack of need. Most residents buy a car	Is it really as bad as everyone says it is? <unfortunately yes < Not at all, February is the coldest, otherwise like everyother location, you get used to cold and learn to adapt. 50 degrees could be cold to some, warm to others, get wool socks and down coat. < As a Minnesotan once you've been to Rochester I don't think anyone would agree the cold there is subjective lol < Yes, this is bullshit lol. The weather is ass from November to May. April is cold and windy and with minimal sunsine. Summers can be hot and humid. There is only a couple of months of the year where I would classify the weather as good.	Lol + 11 < Dating scene is more favorable to men vs women as more women in the population and not enough guys.	young liberal city due to mayo. program has lgbt/dei committee>>> how is dating??? dont want to be single throughout residency lol	Draws patients from all over the world, so most of the diversity is in patient population, has a larger somali population--> Essentially no black or hispanic patients.	Small town, very safe, ppl are nice and friendly
MISSISSIPPI	Jackson	underrated city! great food scene especially for the size. it is smaller but everything is very close and convenient; lots of housing options near the hospital. amazing cost of living can easily buy a house. lots of new things popping up and things to do. you are only 3 hours away from NOLA and close to other bigger southern cities. Oxford, MS and the MS gulf coast are great places to visit.	roads are terrible and water is a major issue in jackson city limits. crime is also getting to be a bigger problem within the city limits. luckily there are very safe options in neighboring cities (flowood, ridgeland, madison) with better roads and water within 15 minutes of Jackson. Reigning champion in being rated the worst city in the U.S. for women	nope	very hot in the summer but fall and spring are very nice. very tolerable winters	bad	friendly	will recieve extremely diverse patient population	
MISSOURI	Kansas City	Fun city, lots to do. Food scene is great and lot more diversity than you think. May have to drive out to Overland Park/Olathe, KS to find other ethnic food. Cost of living is cheap unless you plan on living on the river front where the apartment buildings think they are in New York/LA. City skews more young and liberal. Definitely need a car to get around. Public transport sucks. Did I mention shit ton of breweries and BBQ? Make sure to live on the Missouri side though! (MO side is great, but if you have school aged kids, KS side suburbs have better schools) << Taylor Swift (lol I doubt she would want to live here)	Johnson County cowboy drivers (KS) suck major ass! <<City with the largest % increase in COL this year.    Not diverse at all, very white city. If you're looking for good asian restaurants good luck to you. Also there's nothing surrounding KC that's fun enough to do a day trip to (unless you like the nothingness of rural Kansas or Missouri). Omaha/Des Moines/OKC are so meh. Dallas and Chicago are 8 hours away and Minneapolis is too cold (and also 6+ hours away anyway). Living here feels like you're stuck in the middle of nowhere even though you live in a city.	Public transportation has been expanding in the last few years, but it's not at a point where it is reliable. You will definitely need a car to get around.	We experience all four seasons with really humid summers. It snows about 3 or 4 times each winter, but never more than a few inches.	okay, but not the best. Most people are married or engaged by 25. << Literally no one I know. Dating here is rough dude. Lots of single medical professionals though if you like to mix business with pleasure     Agree with the above, people are attached to their lives here so if you have no plans to stay after residency, probably gonna be tough	Very friendly	Skews white	Pretty high crime rate, leans more violent compared to a lot of places
MISSOURI	St. Louis	affordable, lots of free or cheap things to do, great enormous park, diversity of food options, no traffic, overall an easy place to live	Not a great downtown area, looks abandoned now. Relatively small city, the airport doesn't have as many direct flights internationally and not *as* many direct flights across the US (you can still get to Boston/SF/NYC without connections, but if you want flexibility in travel times, you may have to pick up a connection in Chicago or Detroit). Racial segregation is apparent in the city, specifically in the north city areas, although not places you are likely to encounter, although I don't think this is that much worse than other cities but is more publicized in the wake of the Ferguson Uprising. <highest violent crime of any city in the nation.	There is public transport, but it isn't ideal. There is a metrolink that connects at the medical center and can take you out to the county or into the downtown areas for events downtown (sporting events, etc). There is also a bus hub right at the medical campus that can get you anywhere in the city, but they don't run super frequently. Would not consider this as an option for living further out and commuting. That said, most of what you want to do in STL is nearby to the medical center so there isn't a huge need for those public transport outside of the area.    It is a midwestern city that is not Chicago, therefore, unsurprisingly, the public transit is not great. Parking is abundant.	All the four seasons, pretty mild winters (another opinion: mild is relative, it can get below 0F here, it is DEF an adjustment for southerners). Summers are pretty humid and hot and August is usually a bit unpleasant. +1 Another opinion: woul dsay that winter is definitely mild compared to northern cities, people from Cali/anywhere significantly far south may not feel that it's mild. It's definitely 'you need to own a heavy winter coat' mood.	This is probably one of the weakest areas of this city. There isn't a huge population of educated and available young people that I imagine would be of interest to many of you. There's a sizable county population but those young folks tend to be a bit more conservative, and the populations way out in the county often tend to be married younger and such. Most people I know who have tried to date here end up mostly connecting with others affiliated with WUSTL or SLU just by happenstance.	The city itself is really socially liberal and I think my LGBTQ+ friends feel safe and respected. The Grove, near WashU, is filled with gay bars and is where many of my gay classmates have lived. WashU has a significant OutMed program that connects faculty and trainees who are LGBTQ+ so I think the university in general works hard to be welcoming. >>>what about programs in SLU?	About what you might expect: there is a sizable Black population in the city, but much less so in the county. The CWE is predominantly white, but there absolute is a minotiry population there. Tower Grove South/The Grove/Shaw has more sizable minority populations. There are relatively sizable Jewish, Indian, Thai, Bosnian, and Pakistani populations in the metro area. Compared with many cities, there is not a huge hispanic population, although Cherokee street and the surrounding area does have a high proportion of hispanic people, but they don't make up a huge amount of the city population.	Terrible. That said, I haven't witnessed any crime in 3 years.
NEBRASKA	Omaha	Very affordable, quiet, bomb steaks and ice cream, excellent and diverse restaurant scene all around, nice people, corn, world series. Lots of nice, new, reasonably affordable apartment buildings in areas immediately surrounding UNMC (particularly in Midtown and Blackstone). The zoo is one of the best in the nation. Residents could probably afford to buy a house if desired, definitely so if you have a working SO. They have horse carriage rides. It's for cringe tourists but I still identify as a cringe tourist despite living here for 6 years	Not a whole lot to do outside (pretty flat), winters can be brutal and summers >90 degrees and humid on most days in June through August	Virtually nonexistent. City has been trying to expand the bus system and potentially get a streetcar, but there has been significant pushback from residents. Very car-dependent city, very spread out and not many walkable areas	Humid summers that usually reaches 90-100F. Winters recently have been doable without dedicated snow tires although the wind chill can really get to you.	Mediocre. People tend to marry young, similar to other midwestern cities.	The state of Nebraska has signed legislation that is essentially LGBTQ+ unfriendly, but there is a gay bar in downtown Omaha. Omaha is also relatively politically conservative for a large city.	Omaha is the most diverse region in Nebraska with refugees, Hispanic, nearby American Indian reservations, and African American populations. Rural Nebraska is predominantly White.	North Omaha and Council Bluffs (across the stateline) are the most impoverished regions of the Omaha metropolitan area being redlined and historically ignored by the city with lead poisoning. Otherwise some property crimes even in the affluent West Omaha area.
NEVADA	Las Vegas	Near world class entertainment, food scene is amazing, near major cities in the West Coast for easy quick getaway whenever you want, COL is low comparable to California, sports are up and coming. Thirsty ladies on vacation, too easy	Everyone here is a transplant so doesn't have an innate culture compared to other cities yet, traffic ones everywhere is actually a running joke how much construction happens here, miserable drivers who forget to turn their lights on at night, summers can be brutal.	there are buses but you need a car especially with the gruesome summers	110 degree summers, spring and fall are amazing, rare flurries in the winters	Pretty tough considering a lot of people are from out of town, but manageable	Very strong support	Fairly diverse	
NEVADA	Reno	Great summer weather, lots of outdoors activities, cost of living is reasonable, and despite what locals say traffic isn't actually that bad compared to other cities	College town, food options aren't really great, city isn't exactly diverse	Almost non-existant	Very nice summers, reasonable spring and fall, snowy and cold winters		?		
NEW JERSEY	Camden	Close to Philly. Has a nice aquarium. <<yeah but how often are you going to the aquarium?	Known historically as one of teh most crime-ridden cities in the country. Will definitely need a car to get around.						
NEW JERSEY	Morristown								
NEW JERSEY	New Brunswick	decent food, close to nyc (1 hr on train) hospital is right outside train station, close to princeton and fairly diverse population	it is suburban, so in order to go to most places really useful to have a car.	nj transit train to city, and can go to philly via nj transit --> septa. There are buses but personally never taken it. Rutgers buses run and are free I believe. Small city, to go outside though useful to have car	4 seasons	LOL, lots of grad students but prob expand your limit to the city		Diverse in the city, surrounding areas mostly White and Asian Indian	
NEW JERSEY	Newark	Diverse population, close to NYC. Food is just about edible	You cannot live here, crime is a major problem sadly. Basically, see the Philly response and that's Newark), stinky the way NYC is < eh I'd disagree with that, downtown is up and coming with a lot of nicer apartment buildings and a whole foods, but definitely not that much going on in Newark itself + A LOT of traffic. rat-infested	very nice areas to live around it, city has lots of culture and good and bad parts, but if you are not from the area it would be better to live 15 or so minutes away in a less urban town	Typical East Coast	Great place to pick up international layovers hanging around the airport IKEA. See the NYC response below, you should definitely expand your search to Jersey City/Hoboken/NYC. If you have a car, you can also head north and west to Morris, Essex, Bergen counties to meet suburbanites who still live with their parents. Having a car is essential for NJMS, as well as traveling more for your dates but theoretically you can take a train into NYC. The rats here wont stop having babies so clearly love is in the air		Large Black population in most of Newark, Ironbound/University areas more mixed	Newark is extremely safe, despite the stereotypes. Even its "bad" areas (around the Beth Israel residency) are better than most major cities.
NEW MEXICO	Albuquerque	lots of outdoor activities such as hiking, trail running, biking, skiing. Growing brewery scene. Lots of good food. Housing relatively inexpensive	Not a lot of big city attractions, downtown not as developed as larger cities, if you want to date a lot it might be a bit tough...I literally saw someone get mugged behind a store in broad daylight a few years back in Albuquerque, so...crime is a problem. //////Really bad swamp ass, had to wear two pairs of underwear per day	not great	get all 4 seasons, mild winter with some snow is typical, summer can get up to 100 degrees, beautiful fall, windy spring	not great	great support for LGBTQ+ community.	Mainly Hispanic and Native American populations	
NEW YORK	Albany	Low COL, decent hiking, diverse food options, great museums	Very little to do apart from what was mentioned in Pros, one of the most boring cities in America		Mild summers, long snowy winters		Very good	Mostly White, small Black, Chinese, and Filipino populations	More dangerous than NYC, average Rust Belt city
NEW YORK	Bronx	A lot of great food from many different communities (Dominican, PR, Bangladeshi), more spacious and affordable apartments. Lovely greenspaces with easier ground travel to other mainland US interests (hiking, skiing, etc). Also where my dealer lives, he got me some Paraguayan shit the other day, wild....	Very spreadout compared to Manhattan and other boroughs. If you plan to travel into Manhattan, it can take a long time to get there depending on where in the Bronx you live.... Cons would be you could meet real BX people like me and get stained for ya ishh B.... don't come around here if you ain't tough B we check weaklings who don't belong wrd 2						
NEW YORK	Brooklyn	High COL, many malignant programs, commuting can potentially be a pain. People tend to generally keep to themselves in public so if you value saying hi to strangers then you'll experience some culture shock. >> COVID hotspot, so you can take that as a con or a pro depending on how public health/ID interests you. >> its a big city, but it is pretty easy to feel lonely +1 < its quite busy and packed and for people who are used to a slower/more calm pace of life, it can be dizzying and disconcerting. depends on what exhuasts you. you can also feel trapped in the city and if you need nature to escape, you're going to have to travel a bit to find it (upstate new york) although people do manage to do this as well. Nursing union in NYC is also very powerful - at a lot of places, the nurses will refuse to do blood draws and do not respect your time. They will have no qualms about trying to interrupt your didactics time to deal with something that's annoying them. On the flip side, sometimes they won't let you know when a patient is really sick. < expensive and patient volume is high so you may feel like you are living in the greatest city in the world but you dont have time or money to experience its greatness < a lot of things considered standard in most places are non existent here re. housing (laundry in building etc). <<<< i LOVE BROOKLYN. ive been downtown brooklyn for 3 years and i love it here. yes i pay a lot for rent (i had to downsize this year RIP and its still stupid expensive), but i love the city. right next to like 10 subway lines. honestly i have no complaints	how are housing prices compared to manhattan? < Slightly cheaper but still VERY expensive. Depends on neighborhood but along with price drop also comes the drop in amenities (restaurants, bars, etc) Any area close to the East River towards Manhattan is expensive and you will need to have roommates ( 2 br ~3500, Studio 2800). Further away in prewar apartments (old) rent is lower but places like Park Slope, Williamsburg, Bed Stuy are still expensive. Close to SUNY Downstate there are lots of new builds with great introductory prices for modern amenities builidng. Be prepared to go through a gruesome applicaiton process for housing (it is more like filing your tax returns in terms of effort). Listings move fast (you have to decide within the day if the apartment is yours) and you often pay realtor fee (1 month rent). But having said that everyone gets an apartment this way and you only have to do this hopefully once.	HOW LIVABLE AND ENJOYABLE IS THE CITY ON A RESIDENTS SALARY? Your salary does not go far but if you are sharing the cost of living with others (roommates) you can enjoy the city. Also there is a diverse range of activites that caters to different budget levels. Getting to Manhattan from Brooklyn is fantastic. Traveling to other boroughs and withing Brooklyn can be a pain, but if you live next to a subway stop helps.	Four seasons! all beautiful to take in at Prospect Park- Brooklyn's back yard	go to manhattan <- bad take+1 Williamsburg and Bushwick can hold its own     On the one hand, very few bras, on the other hand, hairy			Very safe outside Bedford-Styuvesant and Canarsie, and even the "bad areas" are safer than most major American cities.
NEW YORK	Buffalo	Friendly people, pretty diverse city for the size, lots of food options, tons of summer festivals in the city, just has an overall charming quality that people tend to fall for, chicken wings, the Bills, on Lake Erie, little to no traffic, very affordable housing, Canada/Toronto very close for a day trip, lots of hiking, skiing and wineries a short drive away	Weather can be tough in the winter becuase it sometimes snows a lot. All the limitations of a mid-size city.	Pretty limited. There is a very limited subway system and a decent bus system. Would need a car as a resident	Typical northeastern summer and cold in the winter (because it snows). Summers are very nice and not too hot, able to comfortably run outside most summer evenings. Winter is tough but not that much worse from living in the midwest. Covered parking is a must for a residnet ... Snows alot because Buffalo is in a snow belt. You have to be ready for tough winters here. Surronding areas even an hour away will get substaintially less snow because it falls out of the snow belt.	Lots of young people << not a lot. Been here for some time now. Not a good dating scene	LGBTQ friendly	White and black	More dangerous than NYC, average Rust Belt city
NEW YORK	Long Island	Close to NYC, good food scene, lots of places are growing and are young people friendly like Mineola, Huntington. Beaches are good, so long as you stay on the South Shore. Good wineries out East.	Expensive, expensive, expensive.... also the people are an acquired taste (source: LI'er born and bred and attempting to flee) +2	Limited, car is best. LIRR is only for LI to NYC tbh. There is NICE and Suffolk transport but its busses and very limited.	See NYC column	B+ (there's options....)	Could be better	LI is actually one of the most segretated places w.r.t. housing in the USA (thanks GI bill) but b/c everyone is in close proximity you can definitely find anything	
NEW YORK	NYC	Da Big Apple baby. Capital of the world. One of the greatest cities, extremely diverse patient population, large number of programs with varied competitiveness, food scene is 11/10, great public transportation, the people here are amazing -- all that i ask is that you don't take up space where you shouldn't and don't waste our time < Preach. NY has energy and if you don't or can't adapt then please stay out. < best city in the world. can find everything here +1 <people are rude but kind as opposed to other places where they are polite but...?	Extremely high COL, like 4K for 1Bed, most of the programs are malignant, workhorse programs, and a lot of them are low resourced so you're doing a lot of non-educational non-resident type tasks that take away from the resident tasks and learning you're supposed to be doing. Commuting can potentially be a pain, if you have a car it's about $500/mo to keep it no matter where you are, so you have to live right by the hospital or your commute will suck. People tend to generally keep to themselves in public so if you value saying hi to strangers then you'll experience some culture shock. >> COVID hotspot, so you can take that as a con or a pro depending on how public health/ID interests you. >> its a big city, but it is pretty easy to feel lonely +7 it's hard to make friends if you don't have some already, especially working the hours of a resident. its quite busy and packed and for people who are used to a slower/more calm pace of life, it can be dizzying and disconcerting. depends on what exhuasts you. you can also feel trapped in the city and if you need nature to escape, you're going to have to travel a bit to find it (upstate new york) also have to go all the way to long island or so if you want access to a beach, summer in the city can be pretty rough. Nursing union in NYC is also very powerful and goes back for decades - at a lot of places, the nurses will refuse to do blood draws and do not respect your time. They will have no qualms about trying to interrupt your didactics time to deal with something that's annoying them. On the flip side, sometimes they won't let you know when a patient is really sick. >> at my shop, the RNs refuse to do ECGs. They legit told it me was inappopriate for me to ask them to do an ECG, and that it is the MD's responsibility. >> City is not safe at all, if somebody is harassing/attacking you, nobody will turn back or even look.	Great subway system but expect delays (although less so in the early morning) << trains are overcrowded during key work start and end times, which can actualy be avoided depending on your schedule. I highly recommend living near the hospital. Yes the subway is amazing compared to other cities, but the MTA will suck your soul if you have to commute long stretches every single day. And I say this as a native Noo Yawka!    Within Manhattan, the subway is the way of life. In outer boroughs, (Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx) the subway is less dense and the bus system is more important. Fortunately, you can transfer between the subway and bus (1 free transfer). In theory, this allows you to get anywhere in NYC on a cheap flat rate ($2.75 currently), although commute time will obviously increase. The MTA works at its best when your home and your work are in a direct subway or bus line without need for transfer, ideally keeping commute times to 20 min or less. Another important note is that the MTA runs 24/7 so you don't have to worry about being stranded at odd times, although train/bus frequency drops at late night hours.	Four seasons but spring/autumn feels comparatively shorter to winter/summer << summers are getting much hotter and nyc goes compeletely dead in the summer because everyone leaves. Cold isn't that bad.<<NYC gets dead in the summer because everyone leaves? Few things I've read about NYC that are more untrue than this.	A+ << horrible for women, amazing for men. The male to women ratio is skewed so that men have the upper advantage and plenty of amazing women to choose from. Ultimately results in men playing games // How hard is it to date in NYC as an Asian-Indian? > As an Asian-Indian woman I have only ever lived in SF and NYC. I think for me dating in SF was easiest, given that there are so many talented, good looking, professional men in SF. NYC was a bit harder for me, I don't get as many matches on OLD as I did in SF, but its still not bad! < something for everyone! lots of professionals here- not just medical so you get to meet peopel who are different and diverse. although theres something to be said about having too many options. I've heard that its easy to date and harder to find a serious relationship <<< TERRIBLE FOR WOMEN!!!! this is coming from a woman <<<dating has been so good for me as a man that i imagine if must be terrible for women. bar must be so low if they find me attractive	I mean...Couldn't be better +1+2 +3	You won't find more than in NYC that much I can say. Some boroughs have less diversity than others (Staten Island....not much, also it's Staten Island enough said)	HIghly dependent on neighborhood. < Not true. NYC is one of the safest cities in America, even the Bronx is safer than many cities such as Pittsburgh.
NEW YORK	Rochester	Not cool with people deleting comments???? Mid-sized city with plenty of charm and good sense of community. Coffee and brew scene is great. Reasonable COL, stellar food scene, lots of parks and small hiking trails (no big mountains tho), ~45 mins from decent ski mountain. Good access to water sports and fishing, although not a ton of paddling opportunity. Areas surrounding hospital are bikeable. People from Rochester love Rochester.	Downtown area isn't super lively - with most of action happening in the outskirts. One of the snowiest areas in the entire US. Crime high in pockets. Where redlining was invented << Effects of redlining are still seen but it definitely wasn't invented here	URMC has a free bus that picks up employees and students from select locations. The Rochester City Bus system is actually quite good but can be kind of seedy. Access to Amtrak. Airport went downhill around Covid, but the Buffalo airport still offers access to all the places you'd want to go.	Summers are the perfect temperature every day. Winters can be cold and snowy. They do very well with road plowing.	Favorable dating scene. Lots of young people.	LGBTQ friendly	Very diverse city	Very high in pockets. Generally safe directly surrounding hospital. < Relatively safe surrounding U Rochester and RRH-UH. RGH is in most dangerous part of city.
NEW YORK	Syracuse	Relatively low COL, people are pretty friendly. Lots of breweries in the area and decent coffee scene. Summer and fall are beautiful upstate. Downtown is making a lot of improvements over the past couple years and pretty lively. SYR airport has been increasing direct flight destinations and frequency of flights.	High poverty, lots of crime (shootings, stabbings) in vicinity of the hospital.		Summer is usually pretty mild with one or two weeks of hot humid weather. really bad winters; winter lasts from Late October to late March/early April. Sometimes it snows a little bit in May. worst of all is the extreme amount of the road salt. You will never be able to keep your car clean in the winter and the city has a lot of uneven pavement where salt water pools on the sidewalk in crosswalks. When you walk to the hospital in the winter your pants will be covered in salt.			Not the most Diverse area but A good mix of a white and black population with some refugees from Africa, Middle East, south east Asia.	
NEW YORK	Valhalla	Home of Westchester medical center. Opinions please!?? > Valhalla itself is not that exciting BUT Westchester is filled with many great small towns 5-15 mins away such as Tarrytown, Sleepy Hollow, Pleasantville etc. These are all more suburban areas but have plenty of cute shops and restaurants to see. Another benefit is the close proximity to NYC - you can either hop on Metro North and take an hour long train to Grand Central, or drive in (~30 miles away.)	Lower CoL than NYC, can get more bang for your back, but ofc not as "exciting" of a place either. Things get sleepy after 8-9 pm.	Westchester is a car dependent suburb. While local public transit exists, it's not a good option for getting to WMC or any of the affiliated sites. Metro North can get you to Harlem/NYC for about $20 round trip off-peak and $26 round trip during peak hours; last train out of NYC is at 2 AM and first train is at 5 AM. Parking at train station is about $10 for ten hours. Amtrak out of Croton-on-Hudson can bring you up to Albany or Buffalo/Canada.	Four seasons. Winter is cold but not particularly snowy. Summer can get hot and humid.	Okayish. People in the surrounding towns are mostly college educated professionals, but you'll have to engage in those communities to meet someone. NYC is close enough that you could date in the city if you were comitted to it.	LGBTQ friendly.	Pockets of diversity, nothing compared to NYC but Westchester Medical itself has good diversity in its faculty/residents esp because there are many IMGs	IMO very safe.
NORTH CAROLINA	Asheville	Some walkable neighborhoods in downtown. I feel safe when I walk around. Great food. Good hikes <1hr drive away including Black Balsam Knob, Crabtree falls, Craggy Gardens, lots of waterfalls. Never cold than 10F, beautiful fall. 1 bedrooms around $1500.	Very car dependent outside of few areas. Mission hospital is HCA hellhole with abysmal staff satisfaction. Many of my. VA attendings came from Mission.	none	Snows ~4 times a year. Summers brutally hot. Fall, Spring, and Winter are amazing.	Very white. Not a lot of things drawing people to the area such as tech firms, banks, big engineering companies, etc. Hard to meet successful women.	Heavily supported	See dating	
NORTH CAROLINA	Charlotte	Feels like a clean, accessible ATL. TONS of breweries. Also, the hospital is in a super nice, ritzy part of town and is considered a very safe area. COL very reasonable , plenty of mid/small market sports teams (hornets, panthers, new MLS team) and super great location to other outdoor things (2 hours to asheville for hiking, 2 hours to NC beaches, 3 hours to charleston, SC)	Honestly not much.	Meh, no one I know uses it	Super mild.	Overall pretty good- lots of young professionals (law, banking, business, medicine, etc)	Friendly	Wide variety in patient population and city composition.	
NORTH CAROLINA	Durham/Chapel Hill	Very green, lots of trails/hiking nearby. Rich community and history. ~3 hours from both the beach and the mountains which are great for weekend getaways or even a day trip.	If you're from a bigger city Durham/Chapel Hill will feel very small and claustrophobic. Drive ~15-30 minutes to get around anywhere you need to go in the triangle area (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill). CH is definitely pretty sleepy, Durham has an okay food scene but likely will obvi let down compared to NYC, LA, Chitown etc. i-40 gets suprisingly bad traffic during rush hours so if youre commuting between raleigh it can be a drag.	There are buses but most students/residents drive; some live close to campus and walk.	Very hot and humid in the summer; spring and fall are perfect; winter rarely snows	It's a small enough city that you may bump into someone you went on a date with (at least, pre-covid). but it's a metro area of 2 million+ people when you factor in durham, chapel hill, and raleigh // overall pretty good! lots of young professionals (medicine, research, tech) moving to the area, one of the fastest growing areas in the country, also pretty diverse	Pretty Friendly overall from establishments(duke, UNC) but Research triangle park(consists of Durham, CH, raleigh) is definitely a "bubble" in terms of "blue" compared to the rest of the state, will definitely have patients who arent so friendly.	CH pretty much a college town, pretty white/empty when schools not in session. Durham more diverse with some urban population, immigrant pop as well.	
NORTH CAROLINA	Lumberton	lot of lumbar	Lumberton is one of the most dangerous regions in the United States and has the highest crime rate in NC. Lots of crime, poverty, and generally not much to do.						
NORTH CAROLINA	Raleigh								
NORTH CAROLINA	Winston-Salem	Low cost of living, nearby hiking, very family oriented, downtown arcades and restaurants, pretty much any store you need on Hanes Mall Blvd, mall with Dave and Buster's and virtual reality arcade, parks, 30 minutes from Greensboro and 1 hour from Charlotte and Durham, has a minor-league baseball team as well as Wake Forest University sporting/entertainment events	Not much to do, geographically segregated by highway 52	Very poor	Very mild overall	Terrible	Not great		
OHIO	Cincinnati	City is beautiful and has so much more variety in the landscape than most of Ohio. -Tons to do, great breweries and local restaurants/shops -Plenty of sports to go to (until this year they often weren’t good but still fun) -Awesome parks -Cost of living isn’t terrible	YOU WILL HAVE ALLERGIES, we're in this weird geographic basin that collects pollen and bad air, so there's surprisingly poor air quality. It's a swing state, so while your vote does matter, you also get bombarded with political ads. It also is the most 'southern' of the Ohio cities. City-wise, the vast majority of the neighborhoods around the hospital/UC are pretty decrepid and not well maintained - kind of depressing to drive around and it doesn't seem super safe tbh. \\The chili here is ass. Somehow more ass than ass itself. Beef tastes like its made from the rubber of shoes that have been dunked in a taco bell bathroom. don't ask me how they found tomatoes that are bitter???. And omfg the seasoning they use. I wish I could complain that its bland but holy shit its just so shit. I wish this was just one Cinci chili place but nah...everywhere. I grew up here, i've tried it all and im surprised my enamel is still in tack from how many times ive vomited it out	Public transpo is fine, but will likely need a car	Very, very humid in summer. And spring. And sometimes fall.	what's the dating scene like in cincy? +2		Larger pocket of South Asian population in the suburbs, more diversity downtown, leans more conservative in the suburbs, more liberal in downtown	
OHIO	Cleveland	Rent can be very cheap if you're willing to look just beyond the campus. Lots of hip neighborhoods (downtown, the Flats, Ohio City, Tremont, Lakewood) and nice suburbs as well if you're willing to live further and drive. There is a large African American and Jewish community. Very diverse compared to most Midwest cities (except Chicago). Good food scene, lots of breweries. Underrated night life. Great city to be if you're into the surrounding nature (Cleveland MetroParks, Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Towpath trail etc.). If you need proximity to water Lake Erie is right there and the Cuyahoga river runs through the city and has scenic walkways/parks by it. Great for sports fans too. There's traffic during rush hour but a joke compared to other major cities.	white bread city (? not sure what this means lol)     Obviously if you're comparing to places like Boston, Chicago, NYC will pale in comparison in terms of overall appeal. Probably lacking in good asian food compared to the coasts	Reliable/Fair, but questionable safety. Everyone in residency drives and if IMG, they lease a vehicle.	All 4 seasons. Standard midwest weather with windchill originating from lake effect. Not as cold as Minnesota. Dress appropriately and drive slow when actively snowing and you will be fine.	Mainly other residents at CCF, UH, Metro etc that are here temporarily and other health professionals as Case undergrad and Cleveland State are in the area. Otherwise, prospects aren't great, especially if you are minority.	Accepting, know of CWRU and CCF residents who are open about their gender/sexuality and there's no concern. The surrounding city population varies.	African Americans are present in nice areas which is refreshing as a black male having lived in Milwaukee and Detroit where segregation is an issue. The universities bring in a lot of diversity. Surrounding suburbs are not at all diverse, but the distant suburbs are.	Cleveland doesn't have the best repulation nationally but I think that's overblown. Obviously there are parts that are worse than others (stay far away from East Cleveland), but there are many pockets of nice areas where young professionals live that have nice restaurants/breweries/parks etc.
OHIO	Columbus	Surprisingly large city with decent food and art scenes. Rent is very affordable. +1 // Good jogging and biking trails and greenery especially at metro parks. fairly mild winters especially the past few years	Four seasons can sometimes mean worst of everything: cold winters, hot and humid summers. Feels like there aren't as many young people as other major cities?	COTA bus lines are available and pretty cheap but not always timely, although they're getting better. there's an app that lets you see where buses are in real time. driving is most convenient tho	has all 4 seasons. usually cloudy/overcast. thunderstorms in fall season. hot in the summer	OSU is huge so there are a lot of students/new grads, though it is still Midwest and people tend to pair up early	Franklin county (campus area) and surrounding counties are more friendly //how is dating???	One of the largest public universities in the US. diversity could be better, though OSU itsef has lots of international students	
OHIO	Cuyahoga Falls	Smaller town in a area of several towns which all tend to blend together due to close proximity(Akron, Hudson, Stow, Fairlawn, Montrose to name a few) . Cheap housing and cost of living, Very family centered area. Nice row of restaurants and bars called Front Street in "The falls" itself. Very safe, not much crime. There is a local gym called the natatorium that is very well maintained. The area has a very close proximity to all the previously mentioned cities like Akron Fairlawn Stow all within 15 minutes. Good public and private schools.   Cuyahoga Valley National Park is here, it has plenty of trails to hike, though not many within a 30 min drive would rank "expert" on the all trails app. Some trails are busier than others, but not overly crowded where you are playing a constant game of leap frog. Cuyahoga Falls is home to Rex's Erection aka Humbold's Tower. It is even a local snapchat filter.  Akron is the Home of Swensons and the Galley Boy Burger.	Houses for sale and rent are older, only a handful of apartment complexes in the falls itself. Has decent food variety for the population of the town, but when you want something fancy, you will likely be headed to Fairlawn, Cleveland, Akron, Hudson or Canton.     Multiple speed trap streets.    Cuyahoga Falls is more housing than anything, and if you want to do any major brick and morter retail shopping you will likely need to drive 5-10 minutes. It has the problem of not that much going on within itself, but it is in a great location to take advantage of several great surrounding cities.	Uber and Lyft are there but not wise to be dependent upon in more remote locations.	Not recommended for those with seasonal depression due to it can be frequently cloudy.    Experiences all 4 seasons    Rainfall is not egregarious    Cuyahoga Falls is far enough away from the Lake to avoid the Lake effect snowfall, the city has great snowplowing, but be advised they use salt not sand    Temperatures can range from -4 to 102. Most of the year is between 80 and 60. Lots of pretty trees to watch during the fall.	It is there, but your best luck will be through the apps due to workload. Plenty of younger people in the healthcare industry working at CCF, Akron City, Akron Childrens, Akron General, UH, Mercy, Aultman and several nearby colleges such as Case Western, Universtiy of Akron, Kent State, Walsh University.	Have not seen any targeting or discrimination. That said, it is a conservative midwest town. YMMV	Predominately Caucasian in Cuyahoga Falls itself. The surrounding cities statistically have more diversity including African American and Nepali, but are still predominately Caucasian. That being said, it seemed to blend together well.	
OHIO	Toledo	cheap, no traffic, really nice zoo	Cold winters, not much to do once it gets cold out (which honestly feels like most of the year). Not too many new restraunts to try once you've lived here for a few months. Have to drive to go anywhere. Not many sunny days but that is most of Ohio.	Basically, no. Will need a car for sure.		You will need to likely set your tinder radius to reach ann arbor and detroit <hahhahahahahaa...tru though	???	Pretty good diversity	
OREGON	Portland	Amazing hikes, great food scene, great for skiing/snowboarding. Has some sports teams (Trailblazers, Timbers). Very LGBT+ friendly. If you love the outdoors, it is absolutely beautiful here and hard to beat. About 1-1.5 hrs from mountain in one direction, coast in the other.	If you don't drink IPAs, ride a unicyle, and bring up fermentation at least once a week, you will be an OUTCAST. Many outdorsy people (if that is not your thing), not the most racially diverse city<<first sentence obs sarcasm << How is the junkie/hobo problem? Last time I was here before the pandemic felt very sketchy downtown at night. Also it seems like there is decent asian food in the burbs (beaverton etc?)	Pretty good for a US city, but it is still more convnient to have a car than not. Buses and light rail aren't that frequent. max $5 day for unlimited rides	Rains frequently but it isn't pouring rain and it usually stops. GRay winters for long periods of time, but summers are amazing.	Disproportionately more men than women	very liberal- one of the gayest city in America (very gay)		
PENNSYLVANIA	Abington	Less dirty than philadelphia. Generally nice suburb area but not too far from center city. One of the best places to love in philly area							
PENNSYLVANIA	Allentown					There used to be this Malt shop near the Allentown Rose Gardens...It was like an irl Tinder. People would go there, start talking to someone, go home and fuck like rabbits. Not sure if there's a more modern version of it these days.			
PENNSYLVANIA	Danville	Very low cost of living, Geisinger maintains nice trails for hiking/biking nearby. Not far (~1hr ) from the Poconos for skiing/snowboarding.	Food options are not great, but there have been some some cute restaurants popping up recently. Not much to do. Super cold winters	No	Typical central PA - hot summers (90F+), cold winters (20-30F)	Lol	lol		
PENNSYLVANIA	Erie	Cheap COL. Traffic is a non issue- you can get just about anywhere in 20 minutes. Peninsula/lake are very pretty- Presque Isle is pretty much the gem of the city.	Winters here are brutal. Large enough to be considered a city but we are missing a lot of things- there are things youd need to drive into Buff/Pitt/Cleveland in order to do or see. Airport is super tiny and hard to get flights in and out of. Limited things to do. We definitely don't have a night life scene. Food is meh- a lot of chain restaurants and not a lot of options.	need a car for sure. also get snow tires	brutal winters. summers are nice.	completely hopeless.	depends on the area you are in	Pretty diverse I think but it is also pretty segregated	Hey everyone, Erie native here. Millcreek lost its IM residency just a heads up. If anyone has specific questions about Erie for any other reason feel free to shoot.
PENNSYLVANIA	Hershey	Cheap COL (apartments for ~1000/month), minimal traffic around the med center. Can drive out to harrisburg in 15-20 minutes for activities in the city/more diverse restaurants. Lots of green space, good hiking within 30min-1hr. Just got an REI 25 minutes away, there's a Trader Joe's coming to 25 min away soon. // Trader Joes is already here, just have to drive to Camphill. Also super cheap COL and can live on the on campus apartment, two bedroom apt is ~1200 so I pay 600 with a roomate	Not a very diverse population nearby. If you live near downtown Hershey, there's some hersheypark/concert traffic on weekends. The food scene in Hershey is just okay, so hard to find good Asian food. // The food scene sucks locally. I had to travel to Harrisburg or Lancaster for anything decently ethnic. There are some fancier restaurants on the short main street, but they are expensive. In Harrisburg check out Broad Street Market, kind of like a mini-Reading terminal with tons of options. The Amish pretzels are very addicting be warned (current Hershey resident)	Basically nonexistent, you'd need to have a car.	A few snows during the winter, usually around 30-40F for the winter months. The summers aren't too bad, not as humid as some other places.	Not good. Mostly hospital people and med students. Harrisburg is nearby, so maybe some professionals there.	Hershey itself is tolerant, but the neighboring regions are a lot of conservative trump supporter types. Lancaster is 30-40 minutes away, and way more LGBTQ friendly.	Central PA is kind of rough. // You do see some spanish-speaking patients (theres a migrant worker population not too far). The hospital itself is diverse, but the patients are mostly white. You are exposed to a decent number of Amish and similar type communities which is unique	
PENNSYLVANIA	McKeesport	Outskirts of Pittsburgh metro, low COL	Everything else. Not safe, chances of being a victim of a crime are high. Absolutely try not to live in downtown McKeesport if you can. Burbs are safer, but boring and long drives to grocery store etc.	Port Authority is okay, you'll want a car if you're living this far out of the city	cloudy and grey (one of worst areas in country for this), long, cold winters with occasional snow, spring and summer are nice, summer isn't too hot	nonexistent	greater pittsburgh area is very LGBTQ friendly	area is a melting pot, lots of AA	
PENNSYLVANIA	Philadelphia	good bar/ food scene. The city is very walkable so no need for a car. Large city so has all the arts/culture, special events, sports, restaurants, etc but feels less intimidating than a city like NYC. Cost of living is reasonable compared to NY/Boston/DC. Great big 4 sports teams	Dirty, poverty-striken (could be pro if you are very into underserved medicine, otherwise can be depressing and high crime), little in the way of outdoors activities, too expensive for what you get <<whew, a bit harsh IMO, but I love philly. yes you will need to travel a few more mins, but there are def outdoor activities, bike trails << lived in Philly during gap years, there's plenty of outside stuff to do but you'll need a car. IMO COL isn't too bad compared to other east coast cities.    If you're in the wrong part of Philly can get the impression that it's dirty/poverty stricken, but there are nice areas like Center CIty etc. Just gotta look around and do your research, be aware of your surroundings	Yes, but can be dangerous. Septa within Philly (mainly along Broad & Market). Patco connects to Jersey. Amtrak to NYC & beyond. << From my time living in Philly, SEPTA isn't great. Philly is a very driveable city.	terrible typical of east coast < would say late spring/summer/early fall are great but there is a true winter. However, it is relatively mild compared to midwest < summer is humid AF worse than winter from this west coaster's perspective < Snowplowing in the winter can be an issue so be prepped to walk/drive in the snow to get to work on occassion. One other concern is a lot of rain! Summer is a lot of random rain.	good, lots of young educated people given all the universities	great	Philly is a city of neighboorhoods which has its own pros and cons, especially with the history of red-lining here. Would say tho that there are many communities represented because of the many neighboorhoods within philadelphia.	Its Philly << +1
PENNSYLVANIA	Pittsburgh	small city w/ big city amenities (big sports teams, great food scene, music, arts); can get around with bus but car is better. amazing COL<< so where do the residents typically live? << check out Shadyside, Lawreneville, and Squirrel Hill	really gray days and long winter+100<< seriously, no joke, it's one of the least sunny cities in USA<< You better invest in a sun lamp here because the sun rarely comes out, especially in the winter.	Great bus system especially for getting to and from hospitals, but car is better for more adventures	really gray all the time...wind chill horrible in winter but never snows /that/ much. really lovely spring-fall but winter is really long	not great, lots of people who were born and raised here, feels like people settle down earlier than other cities	Shadyside is LGBTQ friendly, some gay bars, lots of signs of support on houses (rainbow flags, welcome mats, yard signs etc.)		
RHODE ISLAND	Providence	Has multiple universities and culinary institutions so big foodie and art scene. Public transportation is pretty good. Easy access to Boston / NYC. Lots of direct lines to the main hospital.   lived there for 5 yrs and liked it a lot. small city but has decent cultural footprint due to Brown +other universities in the area including RISD (fancy art school). good food/drink scene for such a small city because of Johnson and Wales (fancy culinary school), also long-standing italian community on federal hill, and other more recent immigrant groups. very walkable and bike-friendly although having a car is handy. public transportation somewhat minimal within providence (bus, dont have much experience with it tbh). easy ~50 minute ride on the commuter rail to boston for $10. COL is good for the northeast, there are a range of options between downtown, college hill/mount hope, federal hill etc. weather is like boston. newport/the beach is pretty close by. new england is small as a whole so relatively easy access to western Mass/maine/vermont/NH if you want to go hiking/skiing. dating is def going to be more challenging than in a major city although like i said boston is close, there are grad students, etc. more diverse than you might expect but not compared to like philly or NYC and more segregated in the way that new england tends to be. very LGBTQ+ friendly.	Traffic, compared to NYC or Boston, is pretty reasonable. Not just traffic, people here drive like its fucking podracing from Star Wars. Reckless af. Easy access to other places in New England.	- bus (iffy), very walkable/bike friendly	- typical new england 4 seasons, humid summer, shorter pleasant spring/fall, colder/dark winter w snow	Opportunities to date other Brown students, not much else.	- very liberal but bad dating across the board		
SOUTH CAROLINA	Charleston	Quaint, touristy, super southern town thats expensive but gorgeous with a bunch of beach activities at your fingertips. Cool market and lots of restaurants  -Amazing food	Def high COL for the salary they give you and the size of the city. IMO living in a touristy place is both a pro and a con (lots of bachelorette parties dt every weekend). Diversity is lacking, very white or black with little other representation and kind of segregated	Not great, definitely a city where you would want to have a car or live downtown somewhere walkable to the hospital	gorgeous all year round. hot and sunny but always a beach breeze	Can't speak from experience, but one of the residents said it was good		low divesity!! Faculty and residents diverse but outsidee of the hospital very white.	
SOUTH CAROLINA	Charleston								
SOUTH CAROLINA	Columbia	up and coming town. the main street is slowly being redone to be more like greenville; there is large developing riverwalk as well. tons of breweries and restaurants. historic city with multiple districts- main street, the vista (historic arsty place by downtown with lots of restuarants), five points for the college scene, Devine street for food and shopping. super cheap CoL; you could definitely but a house here in either the main downtown area or out in the suburbs on the lake. you can be at the beach or the mountains in under 2 hours. very easy to take nice day trips to relax	still run down in areas not mentioned in the pros tab, not much good shopping ( the closest mall is 15-20 from city center), south carolina has the worst roads and drivers I've ever seen in my life	traffic is nonexistent but you'll need a car. public buses but theyre....not good. airport is always empty and super convenient to use. it takes like 10 minutes to get through security and to your gate lol. super nice to fly to charlotte or atlanta to fly out of there for your real destination but not deal with the atlanta or charlotte security wait times	small beach breeze year round. hot summers and mild fall/winters. you can basically wear shorts yearround with the exception of maybe 4 weeks -- untrue, Columbia has actual seasons, it is usually cold (freezing) during december - february (coming from someone who ghas lived here forever)		residency and hospital program are very accepting but unknown about the dating scene in general population.	large african american, hispanic, and indian presences. USC in the middle of downtown brings some diversity with it as well but i would say the main population is WASP. Politically, the city skews conservatively but you can find extremes of both sides	
SOUTH CAROLINA	Greenville	Great, modern downtown with tons of restaurants, bars, things to do. Check out falls park, swamp rabbit trail as well. Close to Atlanta, Charlotte, mountains, beach.	Traffic is not great but not bad compared to any big city. Our drivers houwever are tragic.	A trolley. Cute, but laughable.	Four seasons, sometimes all in one day.	Yikes if you're not white, straight, and christian. but if you are, not bad.	better than anywhere else in SC. that said, its SC.	Not bad for SC. Again, its SC. Generally racism here is subtle.	
TENNESSEE	Memphis	lots to do in memphis. good BBQ and food. cute unique places to eat and coffee shops. street full of live music. lots of bars. great culture. diverse town. everyone is really kind. Grizzlies games are fun and cheap.	crazy drivers, terrible crime. over 13000 car jackings a year, >1500 shootings a year-- several high profile cases including St. Jude post doc murdered. Very little policing due to Tyre Nichols case. no reliable public transit. hot and humid climate, rains a lot and has poor utilities infrastructure so power is often out. dating is atrocious. not much to do in the city.	It exists but is unsafe and extremely unreliable	hot humid summers, cold humid winters, snow shuts down the entire city and they have a really tough time clearing it off the roads if a snowstorm hits - during the last snowstorm in 2021 some residents had to stay in the hospital for over a week because they couldn't get home	idk I've been too busy trying to survive memphis, most residents come in with a significnat other or stay single		majority African American with the remainder mostly white	Just FYI memphis is the #1 big city for violent crime and routinely top 3 for non-violent crime. Stay strapped if you come here, seriously. Residents have had cars stolen INSIDE hospital parking lots while parking attendants just watched, if you leave literally anything in your car, even loose change or a jacket, it will be broken into. If you drive a truck or large SUV it will be broken into at some point by someone looking for guns. Most residents live in either gated apartments or a house. DO NOT DRIVE A KIA/HYUNDAI HERE, if you really must please, please get a steering wheel lock. The police have been handing them out for free because your car WILL get broken into if parked publicly if it is korean, thanks kiaboys. Also, there is a no chase policy currently in place (if someone drives off during a traffic stop police are not allowed to pursue unless they are an active threat) and non-violent criminals are guaranteed to get out on low bail thanks to the current elected judges who are very soft on non-violent crime. I have lived in multiple large cities and this is the only one where you have to take extreme precautions to not be a victim of crime. Also, ~10-15% of the cars on the highways will have drive-out tags (paper tags) that are expired or fake. They no longer pull people over for these, and most of those cars are either stolen or stolen and sold to an unsuspecting buyer. In fact there are no vehicle inspection so you'll routinely see people driving stolen altimas going 100 on I-240 with the bumper dragging on the ground with police staring. I've seen multpile people drive through red lights (not turning yellow to red, floridly red for 10+ seconds) with cops just staring, they literally don't care. In fact, unless you are actively being shot to death in a decent neighborhood don't expect a rapid police response, if any. Someone got shot 5 times near me recently and it took 20 minutes for any cops to show up, I live 8 minutes from the police station like wtf.There's a reason why UT had to invest so much money into their own campus police force. Also don't honk or flash your brights at anyone when driving on I-240 unless you like lead poisoning. Also TICU (trauma ICU) is super depressing because of all the gunshot victims.
TENNESSEE	Nashville	Emerging liberal city, lots of new restaurants/bars. Lots of live music options even if you don't like country music (occasional Taylor Swift spottings). Plenty of young people moving here (including hipsters). Great city/state parks with hiking/biking trails within a short drive. super dog friendly city. COL is manageable and rent isn't bad if you live a little further away from downtown. Most people are very friendly. Safety is good around med campus.	Rent is getting expensive around downtown. Lots of bachelorette partiers and drunk people on weekend nights. Traffic around rush hours around med centers/people here drive terribly. Definitely feels like a small city if you come from large coastal places. <IMO rent is too high everywhere. Becoming more diverse but still not diverse enough IMO. Patient population is, at least for Vandy, from a much larger catchment area and is not diverse.	Not great. Buses are free for commuting for Vandy med staff/students but most people drive.	Summer is hot and humid. Spring/fall are great temperature wise but people here get terrible allergies. Winter has a couple days of 20-30sF. Parts of this city floods easily -- I'd check a flood map before buying a house. Occasional tornado warnings (with purge siren). People are scared of snow.	Lots of young/professional types moving in these days, so overall pretty good.	In Nashville, there's a reasonably sized LGBT community (for the size of the city) and most people are welcoming. If you go way out into the country...well it's the South	Not bad. Certainly not east coast big city level, but you'll see people of all races unless you exclusively hang out at honky tonks --> Not great if you're an African American trainee. Black professional crowd clustered around places like Fisk, Tn St, and Meharry. Not much racial patient diversity per residents +1	
TEXAS	Austin	Live music capital of the world. Some of the best music venues are within walking distance of the hospital. Great food scene, including some of best BBQ in the world in the city or within a 2 hour drive. Tons of great, expansive greenspaces throughout town, and some great hikes just outside of town. UT football, F1, ACL, SXSW. Rainey Street is one of the best bar districts around. Dozens of awesome craft breweries around town. Pretty great dating scene since UT Austin alone has a population of 50k. Pretty liberal/hipster. Great LGBTQ scene. Lot's of activism if that's your jam.	traffic is the absolute worst, even if you live near medical center. (constant construction, poorly designed layout) Pretty high rents anywhere near central or downtown Austin. Not a very diverse city, gentrification actively making it less-so. < its getting expensive, but does not have the amenities of much larger, cheaper cities, gentrification is really bad here, the minority population in Austin is disappearing, traffic is really bad as the city is growing way faster than infrastructure can keep up. Homelessness is a pretty significant issue here	Guess you haven't driven in Houston>>Austin public transport practically non-existent < worse than non-existent, the few metro stations are in the middle of nowhere and a complete waste of taxpayer money	Hot 9 months a year. None of the natural disaster-type weather the rest of Texas gets.	great if you are under 35-40 yo < not gonna lie, its pretty nice	great	Less than other major Texas cities and dwindling with the massive-scale gentrification of East Austin and Riverside areas. < Very white, and South Asians moving in due to tech jobs; black population rapidly decreased at alarming rate over the past decade	
TEXAS	Dallas	Lots of food options for all kinds of dietary preferences. Affordable living. Cheap major airport.	Not much nature aside from lakes; traffic is horrible, starting to get expensive < you may lose power if it snows due to "required blackouts", - Instead of writing about your own bias maybe write helpful information?+2	The DART is okay, not spectacular. Really easy to go to Mavs games though	Mostly hot, can get as low as 19 degrees in the winter, doesn't snow really. Once in a while there may be snow flurries. Hail. < its frustatingly hot, and most of the city is concrete with very little shade. 55 days >100 degrees in 2023	excellente. But also ranks #1 in the country for extramarital affairs	very tolerant, very large gay community for a Southern/SW city	great bc its just a huge city! < would disagree, mostly white, more diverse in surrounding suburbs like Plano and Carrolton which can be 20-30 min drive	
TEXAS	El Paso	Dry heat, cheap rent, nice people, lots of mexican restaurants, big city that feels small, great hiking places, beautiful women. Beautiful sunrises/sunsets. Fun things to do. Close to NM, Riodoso. Mountains are gorgeous.	Good Mexican and Asian food (pho, noodles). Patients mostly Spanish speaking but often bilingual to a good extent. Not too many things to do on your day off, the least diverse city in the US. Black people are treated poorly here. Lots of microaggressions. (again not my experience with the last two sentences). >>>Asian food sucks here and the city is quite isolated, everything is 4 or more hours drive away.	need a car!!	hot summers, very mild winters. Not for anyone who loves rain. Snow shuts everything down.	Mostly army base to date men if ur into that	tolerant	Diverse ethnically (Latin America, etc.) but race 80% Hispanic. LGBTQ+. Not a friendly place for black people in the city (lots of microaggressions) (has not been my experience)	Everywhere basically feels safe, large army base that's often out in the community.
TEXAS	Fort Worth	Big city amenities with small city feel; college town elements with TCU, football games are awesome; decent night-life but can get repetitive; COL is pretty good; DFW metroplex has everything you need if you're willing to drive; Trinity river and trails are nice; great museums; commute to the hospitals very manageable since they're all located in the medical district	still a conservative city, so can be pretty racist especially once you get outside of the city limits (but that's very slowly changing, maybe?); food scene is pretty meh once you find the few hotspots; heard the dating scene is hit or miss.	ok; tram that runs to Dallas is good; bike stations around the city for rent. <<Also new train to DFW airport takes about 40 minutes for like $2.5 a trip.	Hot (+1000); hail is always a threat << it doesnt hail this often too factor into ranking programs IMO.	OK, it's a college town and there's two med schools and lots of professionals, but I've still heard that it can be pretty hard to find people (+1 the pickings are slim). TCU local, easy dating if you're good looking. < Good if you're white, otherwise head to Dallas	Tolerant. Small, but have seen same-sex couples walk around Magnolia area and W7th.	Meh, but the DFW metroplex as a whole is pretty diverse, large refugee pop in FW	
TEXAS	Galveston	Galveston is a beach town on an island! It has a small/medium-sized town feel, Houston is close enough to drive to if you want a night out, and the beach is walking distance from the hospital. Residents live either on the island or over on the mainland in Texas City or League City (the mainland tends to be more popular for residents with families; I've heard the public schools there are a little better). Rent is cheaper than what you'd expect for a resort town. Also the seafood is awesome. < Agreed! Weekend cruises are super cheap.	Quite a bit of tourism traffic on weekends in the summer, though it seems to quiet down once you hit September. Beaches are gross and known for high levels of bacteria/silt after rain. Lived in galveston for 4 years, the food in the place SUCKS. Like it is horrible, and seafood gets old after a couple months. With the exception of some Taco trucks, you better know how to cook or be prepared to drive to Houston.	There's a bus system (kind of limited and I don't think it runs on Sundays but it's there) and a trolley. There's also a free car ferry if you want to go to Bolivar Peninsula (or if you just want to see the dolphins)	Sunny, hot and humid summers with mild winters. Note that hurricanes happen occasionally (didn't get any this year though!).	Not bad, especially if you're willing to drive to the mainland to date. It's not a big town but it's in a pretty populous region of Texas.	Supportive	Home of Juneteenth!	
TEXAS	Houston	Huge medical center, huge city. Lots of running trails along bayou, around Rice U.. The nightlife scene is fun and varied with a downtown as well as more laid back areas. Food scene is amazing! Huge international airport. Lots of different events always going on by virtue of the fact that it's one of the largest and most diverse US cities	So, so humid. A lot of people say traffic, but IMO it's not that bad if you're living pretty close to the medical center. It's when you have to commute in from Katy or one of the other surrounding areas that traffic probs starts to hurt. Have to drive to get to most places though unlike NE cities. Also not a ton of good hiking in surrounding area since Houston is really flat.	metrorail runs through med center. Lots of apartments on the rail line. Can be very sketchy when it's dark, but early morning there are usually metrorail workers patrolling	Humid, hot, FLOOD AND HURRICANE risks, gets actually nice around October but then heats up again around late March/April. Mild winters	Not NY or LA but it's one of the largest cities in the country so plenty of young professionals and fairly diverse. Oil industry is big - lots of engineers. Med center is also huge so if you're trying to date in medicine there's the UT Houston folks to avoid co-mingling in the program	Very tolerant. Houston was one of the first cities in the US to elect an openly gay mayor. Montrose is the "Gayborhood" with great nightlife and would argue it's one of the largest/most friendly LGBTQ scenes I've ever lived around.	The most diverse city in the nation for 10+ years in a row. Large Vietnamese and Hispanic populations. Nigerian community as well. Indian diaspora is strong, esp. in suburbs. Makes for amazing clinical experiences and SUPERB food scene. YOU CAN FIND ANY AND EVERY CUISINE IN THE WORLD HERE FOR CHEAP! After living in Houston, you'll be craving diversity whenever you go to other cities.	Traffic / urban sprawl is biggest con. Best tex/mex in texas. Great asian food, bbq, seafood. Honestly this is thebest food town ive ever been to… you can get fat here. Nightlife is great for whatever scene you are looking for and much more affordable than other large cities. Very diverse
TEXAS	Lubbock	Very cheap  No traffic  Decent public transport / bike paths etc  Football and basketball  Often sunny, rarely humid  Solid bar scene (kind of standard college town)  Nice campus  Great athletic facility / gym and outdoor pool with lazy river  Great public golf course you have access to (ranked high nationally)  Great BBQ  Great city to explore the outdoors from (I drove all over West Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado on weekend trips to explore Canyons, Caves, Big Bend National Park, Deserts is New Mexico, Colorado mountains, and so on)	A bit far from main Texas  Not the cheapest airport to fly out of  After a few years you’ll have explored most of the good restaurants  If it snows the city shuts down. Doesn’t snow a lot though  Not a lot of good ethnic food in town		Lubbock probably has the best weather in the state. It gets just as hot as the bigger cities, but without the humidity. A handful of very windy days per year would be the worst of it.				
TEXAS	Midland-Odessa	Anyone has any input besides being in the middle of nowehere? <<< not really any positives to speak of. I will say one positive is that people are extremely nice! Very friendly, community-oriented Southern culture.	There's nothing here. It's an oil boom town so it is very cheap until a boom hits and then prices get out of control< What about the dating scene? << lots of tumbleweeds and mesquite bushes available for dating but that's about it.	Whats that? You need a car to go anywhere	Take a guess. Extremely dry, typically in the 100s in the summer. Random hail. Roads flash flood because rain is not common. Occasional snow in winter.	Nope.	Who? << lol	Significant hispanic and asian populations, but largely white, conservative. Attending physicians are fairly diverse!	yes, depends on boom/bust cycle
TEXAS	Rio Grande Valley	Lowest COL in the country, really kind people, DO NOT NEED to speak Spanish despite rumors. Easy commute to most hospitals and clinic sites. Beautiful women. Amazing authentic Mexican food. Medium sized city. Very close to amazing beach	Social scenes can be very clicky due to most people being born and raised in the valley. Heat during the summer can be outrageous with temperatures sometimes reaching or feeling like it's in the triple digits. Heavy rain caused pretty bad flooding in certain areas. Lots of disposition issues with patients in the region. No one from any other part of Texas wants to live here which says a lot.	None.	Very very hot	Lots of beautiful women everywhere. Mainly Latinx.		Mostly latino/hispanic	
TEXAS	San Antonio	Best Mexican food you'll ever have. Big city but a small town feel. Good road system. Very affordable. Great city for families. Go Spurs Go. +2	The city, much like the spurs, does not have too much going for it.>>> I love this comment...so true	Minimal				Mainly hispanic, but still a large metro area with diversity	
TEXAS	Temple	Satellite of Austin, cheap rent or mortgage. One of the more affordable places in central Texas to live. Also you are 1 hour from Austin and 2 hours from Dallas so it is easy to go to bigger cities for more fun things to do. Somewhat of a college town too as there is a smaller university out there. Also some of the best Texas BBQ you can have out here.	small town, not much to do.	nah bruh, may become the center of proposed high speed rail for Texas (praying)	Hot	Austin dating scene is great. Temple dating scene is not so great.	Smaller city, but tolerant and open	overall representative of Texas, relatively diverse, but still majority white	
UTAH	Salt Lake City	any input on SLC? specifically, socially if I am not super outdoorsy, a more liberal person, not LDS, don't love super cold winter, and the dating scene... SLC is beautiful and a really comfortable and easy place to live. Its not like some huge city, but it has the regular bars, restaurants, and breweries that are good. The main attraction is the outdoors, its unbeatable how close you are the mountains. you can get off work and go on a hike (like a real mountain hike) or go skiing or climbing or biking. You can find your niche here that is non-LDS. I will say most people here are pretty outdoorsy. SLC is pretty liberal, it gets more conservative/religious the further out of SLC you go. Winters aren't very cold, its like 30-40s wtih several snow storms, but they city responds to the snow well and is up and running pretty quick. Having 4 wheel drive is helpful though. CoL is increasing as more people move here. Tons of nice apartments being built, but you can find cheaper places to live like renting houses. you can easily live within 10-15 mins to hospital. parking can be hard and you have to pay for a pass. if you get there before 7 you can safely find a spot though. low crime compared to other cities, people are friendly. lot of good dog walking spots.	The LDS church has a lot of control over the state, specifially in politics and regulations, for example weird liquor laws. Also the republicants have gerrymandered this state like crazy. Diversity is improving, but still not like other cities. < I have personally experienced a lot of racism and discrimination in Salt Lake. This hopefully is not the experience for everyone, but this is something to be aware of.	trax that runs through salt lake and you get it free with your card. for getting places other than the hospital, you need a car	all 4 seasons, summers can get hot up to 100. spring and fall are beautiful. winters aren't too bad, 30-40s and snow is pretty. warning: in the winter there is the inversion which can make the air quality poor and city looks ugly and smoggy. dry heat and dry winters help make it not so bad	meh, not great but not horrible. lot of people here are married and LDS get married young so lot of people "settled down" Does anyone have any additional thoughts on this? Not much to add to what has already been said	friendly, most bars/restaurants have pride flags up. Theres drag brunch thats fun. pride parade in june is super fun downtown. a few queer bars	mainly white, hispanic, and pacific islanders.	
VERMONT	Burlington	Incredible year-round outdoor activities. Lake Champlain for swimming, so much good hiking nearby, some of the best East Coast skiing within 1 hour drive. Lots of local breweries. Some of the best pho in the country. Pretty much no traffic. Walkable downtown area. Near Montreal and Boston. BTV Airport has no line ever and is very closeby and relaxing.	Gets cold in the winter. Snow tires are pretty necessary from end of November to March if you need to drive when it snows. Not very ethnically/racially diverse, although becoming more so. Rent can be expensive downtown (~1k+ for 1bedroom). Plenty of elitist liberal vibes.	Bus system but limited.		any insight? Probably not as much as a large metro area, but it's more or less a big college town with bars, breweries, clubs if that helps. Small yuppie population but it exists. > it's pretty darn yuppie. Even the crunchier outdoorsy people have yuppy vibes in my opinion. >>yuppy as fuck. i dont recommend	Very friendly! << can anyone comment on things to do, local bars/businesses, dating scene, etc??	NONE	
VIRGINIA	Charlottesville	Grew up here, went to UVA, and live in Richmond now. Charlottesville is a great small town - very local feel. Lots of students around with undergrad, grad, Law, Business and Med School. City as a whole is pretty liberal. 3.5 hrs to VA beach, 2 hrs to DC, <30 minutes to mountains. Great restaurants, big names for live music come to JPJ, lots of hiking and big brewery and vineyard scene. Also if you're looking to start a family, this is a good spot too - school systems are really good. And if you're single, definitely more young people over last 10 years.    Nice local places to live: Downtown and Bellmont area	Sometimes a bunch of guys in polos get tiki torches and start a riot <-- LMAO	Have to drive most places, but there is a bus system that's pretty easy to get around on. Also a trolley around grounds to downtown.	Hot and humid summers, mild winters, legit snow only a few times per year in Jan-Mar.	Poor. Many residents married/with families. Dating options limited outside the hospital and the university.	Friendly, lots of well-known LGBT-owned businesses.	Best for the outdoorsy people! Great weather, beautiful scenery. Safe place.	
VIRGINIA	Fisherville	Fishserville itself does not have a lot to it, but the surroudning communities in Augusta County, particuarly Staunton have a good amount to offer. You're also under 2 hours from NOVA/ DC, 30 minutes from Charlottesville, and 1.5ish from Richmond. You have easy access to Shenandoah National Park to the east and George Washingotn Forrest to the west which have great trail and backcountry hiking. Local brewery and winery scene is actually decent given the location. Very cheap, QoL.	It is rural, nightlife is limited if thats your thing.	None.	4 seasons, winters and summers are mild, much less humid than the rest of VA east of the mountains.	Not going to be great. , I live 30 minutes from Augusta health and the dating scene is horrible given it's kinda in the middle of nowhere, Charlottesville is a city-ish place closer but the dating scene is still limited	Staunton is very LBGTQ friendly and you're close to Charlottesville which is as well. Otherwise it is a rural and red county for the most part, but people are generally accepting.	There is a large immigrant community, but is otherwise very white	
VIRGINIA	Richmond	Small-Medium size city, very artsy since VCU and Brand Center are there. Good restaurant scene, underground music, and festivals. City is pretty liberal and diverse. Very outdoorsy - Kayak/Fish on James River, Party on Belle Isle or Browns Island, 1.5 hrs to mountains, 1 hour to beach, 1.5 hrs to DC. Not much 'clubbing' night lift, but good beer scene. Very laid back and chill place to live overall.    Great place for families or singles - fairly young city, but mixed with legacy families. Affordable cost of living. Very residential, lots of mixed residential/business living areas which makes for ecclentic neighborhoods    Best places to live: The Fan, Church Hill (close to hospital), Shockoe Bottom (close to hospital, lots of loft apartments) Northside, Manchester (up and coming)	Smaller city - airport is decent and can get you anywhere - direct flights to NYC, ATL, Denver, Chicago, Miami. Most west coast are all 1 stops.	Bus system is ok. Can get you most places in the city. best to have a car.    Certain places you can walk to the hospital or within city depending on your neighborhood (and if you like hills)	Fall is beautiful - 50s    Winter is tolerable - 30s/40s (snow maybe once a yr)    Spring is milld, but short - 60s/70s    Summer is hote and humid - 80s/90s	Big enough city that there are lots of fish in the sea, but small enough that I saw a number of my med school classmates on Hinge <<whats wrong with seeing your classmates on hinge..?		Almost 50% Black in city, 50% white in city. City is pretty liberal. Surrounding surburbs skew more white (and more conservative)	
VIRGINIA	Roanoke	Close to a lot of beautiful nature (lakes, right by the blue ridge parkway, mountains, close to shanendoah), has atleast one of everything (except Trader Joes, costco), very affordible, plenty of events happening all year round, sports teams (minor league baseball, railyard dawgs), lots of open green space, rapidly growing city, and of course the star	A lot of urban decay; not a very young or happening city, very quiet<--The city isn't super young but there is quite a large crowd of younger people (from the hospital, virginia tech, grad students, etc)	Basically does not exist but city is drivable and mostly free parking everywhere	All four seasons, can get quite hot and humid in the summer, snow rare and usually only lasts a day or two but will shut down the city	3/10	some but limited, this is improving	not a very diverse city	
WASHINGTON	Seattle	Proximity to nature, Summer is AMAZING. Truly beautiful place to live. Very LGBT friendly. Good music scene. Progressive. < skiing, beach, mountains, lakes, climbing all within 45 mins of downtown seattle. < awesome food scene, lots of things to do. total rainfall is actually less than NYC, but there are a lot of days where it drizzles in the winter. extremely low violent crime (not even in top 50 of major US cities).	High COL, dark all the time in the winter, traffic, Has the country of CHAZ (basically a bunch of homeless people and liberals who think doctors should only make 80k a year). < lol this person doesn't know what they are talking about and clearly watching too much Fox news +10 < broken clock is right twice a day...	Decent in the city but not great outside of the city, may end up stuck in traffic <— understatement of the year. I'm a resident in Seattle without a car- it's very doable in case anyone is wondering that>>I second that! Public transport is great here compared to other big cities< also am a resident here, moved from the south. public transport here is some of the best in this nation (definitely best on the west coast).	Summers are really great, winters are gloomy but don't get that cold  It's pretty much gray from October - May< Would add that alothough summers are mostly beautirful and moderate in temp, we usually get 1-2 weeks of >90 temps, and AC in Seattle apartments is super rare. Those have been some of my hardest weeks living here.	Decent, fair amount of "tech bros'; Seattle freeze is real +1 < seattle freeze may be real but you will be friends with your residency class so moving here for residency isn't a big deal	Excellent ; As good as it gets, tbh (Except maybe Portland?)	B-. City is getting gentrified thanks to tech/Bezos. < Seattle is 20% asian and it shows in the food scene :)	
WISCONSIN	La Crosse	One of the most beautiful cities in WI. There is hiking in the bluff, small streams for fishing, plenty of trails, and the Mississippi River. Oktoberfest is one of a kind.		Transportation is good for the size of the city.	Summers get hot and winters get cold. Typical Wisconsin weather	Good but not the best. Mostly college students.			
WISCONSIN	Lebanon	Lots of outdoor things to do. Skiing, hiking, paddle boarding. Super nice community. Great produce. >> go there if you like any of these aforementioned activities only>> "Produce" is definitiely in my list of hobbies so hoping to get some love.	Super white, lacks diversity and March/April is a grim month with snow and cold weather>> agreed, the diversity is so lacking and it is really difficult to bring up issues with admin, they like to use a complexity score from Medicare to say they are on par with other New England health systems but that is just simply not the case <- Dartmouth is a HUGE catchment zone for Maine/NH. Yeah, they may not have many black people, but there is diversity of medical care. I don't think that a lack of "minority patients" is a deal-breaker < i think for a lot of minorities, constantly being a "token" or the only minority person in their program or living in an area where there are hardly any other minorities is mentally exhausting after awhile. <-- My non-white friend at Dartmouth-Hitchcock says it's a headache with the rural white patients and racist nurses. << yeah beyond catchment area though like serious medical issues and second looks go to Boston<-- Obviously can't argue with it not being ethnically diverse but socioeconomically its extremely diverse and there is a ton of medical diversity, anyone implying that seriously sick patients and second looks go to boston has absolutely no idea what they are talking about. <<Im a resident here at Dartmouth the medical complexity is super high. we see some crazy stuff here and the patients can be super complicated. I see rare stuff you only really see in textbooks on almost a weekly basis depending on what rotation im on. Also see balance if bread and butter. Youll be trained well here. Political stability of Lebanon is currently at an all-time low due to vacant presidency for 15 months, deep economic/social crisis, and sectarian divisions/external meddling from regional powers like Iran and Saudi arabia.	Relatively non-existent>> a bus is available that operates infrequently. there are 2 uber/lyft drivers	Snowy, cold, ski weather>> Fall is an experience though so there's that	Rough-Though tinder is great>> definiitely not great, lots of people you match with are from Boston/Burlington, there is a law school somewhat nearby in Vermont but otherwise just come here with an SO	People who are here are great, but small dating pool>> small meaning non-existent. LGBTQ scene is really pulseless here.	Not diverse. All the diversity comes from the student population at Dartmouth	
WISCONSIN	Madison	Tons of outdoors things, lots of bars, college atmosphere when you want it but you can also go to other neighborhoods where it'll be fun yet mroe adult. Suprising food scene given size. V friendly people +1 >> lake life is a plus, great downtown farmer's market, live music around the capitol in the summer, overall many summer events	Smaller city. Very very white. Only walkable near campus, downtown/around the capital, and into the Willy St. area. Otherwise you will definitely need a car.	Students (and I believe residents) get free access to the bus system. Still best to have a car, particularly if you have rotations at The American Center or Meriter.	Mid November to April is miserably cold, very windy as well. It snows, but not as much as places that deal with lake effect such as Cleveland and western NY. Summers are nice, warm but not too humid. >> As someone who went to college in NY, I would say the winters are just as miserable in Madison, especially when you're driving around in all the snow. Definitely would invest in a hefty parka	Not great. Many people get married young in the midwest. Dating options limited to the hospital, university, and the large population of transplants working at Epic.	small scene with just a couple bars. Overall v supportive incl gay mayor, gay senator. UW initiating first LGBTQ fellowship. Less opportunity for connection with other LGBTQ POC		
WISCONSIN	Milwaukee	ANYONE? please +1 current intern: LOVE it. so many great neighborhoods and restaurants and super reasonable cost of living. people are nice and it's easy to get around. right on the lake and tons of stuff to do. winters are tough and cold but summers are GORGEOUS.    Hi, did undergrad in MKE: surprisingly good food scene. Tons of things to do in the summer, including Summerfest (biggest music festival in the USA). Winters are cold and windy, no lie there. Summer/spring/fall much better, great weather. Great sports teams (brewers, bucks), good for night life, lots of breweries. Lake Michigan is gorgeous and gets warm in the summer beaching. Good cost of living for sure. Lots of concerts to go to, the Rave has reasonable tickets. Close to chicago for weekend trips.	definitely a mix of red/blue politically speaking. some pockets not as safe but still not bad. always compared to Chicago	basically non-existent. you need a car	summer is GLORIOUS and you can get to the lakefront really easily and do boat tours down the river for a bunch of different breweries (pre-covid)	Pretty good, lot of people on the dating apps here, lot of 'professional' people to date. Dating apps skew pretty heavily white though	Smaller community but theres a couple neighborhoods with gay bars and clubs. Overall the vibe is very supportive. Hadn't had issues out with BF personally >> There is a lesbian bar! (one of few left in the country)	very white but still good pockets of diversity, especially downtown -> Not sure where this person is getting their information, Milwaukee is 39.9% white, 39.4% black, and 19.9% Hispanic. Less white when compared to Chicago (45.3% white) [source: cencus.gov] Bad for Black People: https://www.blackexcellence.com/worst-cities-for-blacks-in-america-in-2023/	Can be a lot, especially if you live downtown rather than in one of the surrounding suburbs. Even then theft is still possible. Look up local and up to date crime statistics when deciding where to move to if you wind up here, as some neighborhoods are pretty rough.
