Helps for wellness and/or pursuing research/other projects    3+1 schedule allows for guaranteed full weekend every single month. Also guaranteed average of 1 day off per week during the 3, giving you 5 days off per month, which is above the ACGME requirement of 4 days off per month which most academic residency programs abide by very strictly. Also large residency class makes it very easy to get consecutive days off if you need to go to a wedding or something. Also we are one of the highest paid residency programs now because of our union. LA can be very expensive so it was long overdue. I would strongly recommend factoring in whether a program has a union if you're planning on living in a city/high COL area. Oh and 55 person size.

For example, 5 MICU teams, 1 team is just midlevels which helps with making sure call days aren't banannas.	Amazing, social workers/pharmacists helpful with discharge planning on all services. On oncology services, they come in super clutch	0	depends on service, but usually 8 patients, but later in the year will be single intern a lot and will need to carry the list when your senior is off.

Short call/long call	7-5, Call 7-7	yes	0	Y	1 person and its the senior on the team on most days except when they're off, then it's the intern	Daily: Morning report 730-830 & Noon Conference. 5 intern academic half days and intern report when on outpatient clinic electives	Hard to quantify this because not a ton is done during intern year, but many blocks pgy2 and pgy3. Better way to think about it is inpatient time. As an intern, you're required to do 4m general wards, 1m ccu, 1m micu, 1.5m oncology, 1m hepatology, 2wk general cardiology, and ~5 weeks of night float. Rest is elective and clinic time where you might also have assigned coverage. For the remaining two years together, you have to senior 4-5m general wards, 1m CCU, 1m MICU, 3m of inpatient subspecialty wards (pick between hepatology (2wks inpt/consults), cardiology (2wks inpt/consults), oncology, & VA ICU), and at minimum 1wk of ccu nights and 2 wk of MICU nights. Remaining time is spent on electives, nightfloat, or research, which means you end up having way more free time, your last 2 years	3 weeks (15 days) + 10 sick days as intern. 4 weeks as a senior, You get to pick two weeks and the other 1-2 are decided for you. One holiday is guaranteed off between christmas/thanksgiving and you work the other regardless of if you're on elective or clinic	No, but hospital is downtown and most residents live in apartment buildings with gyms so this hasn't been an issue	$250 quarterly to use at in hospital restuarants plus free food at noon conference and morning report. No cafeteria in the immediate hospital, instead has multiple chain restaurants on their 2nd floor (burrito beach, cafe petito starbucks, panera, pizza studio, greek kitchen, saigon sisters, subway, protein bar). Next door buildings to the main hospital with tall boy taco, ramen san, M burger, lyfe kitchen, and sweet mandy b's. The OBGYN and pediatric hospitals close by have cafeterias though with dunkins and potbelly	Great program, supportive PD, and super chill residents who place emphasis on wellness. Great place for Cards/Heme Onc/PCC, not the best for GI if you're not ready to gun and fight for pubs/posters since so many residents want GI and the faculty aren't always the nicest.	0

Tufts	0	3+1 Intern year, 3+3 Years 2/3. << When do residents go home on short call days?    Goldens occur most of the +1's, +3's. The Inpatient ward is broken down into a pattern of 25% Golden, 50% gray, 25% black. Total # of black weekends only numbers up to about 2-4 over the entire academic year. << what is a black weekend? <Black weekend = long call Saturday admit til 7pm, then post-call Sunday - can leave once your work is done and sign out to cross covering long call intern. Typically 2pm-ish, but highly variable on the census. Gray = off Sat, long call Sunday, Silver = post-call Saturday, off Sunday. For your +1 weeks, there are a smattering of Friday night float coverages intern year that can ruin a +1 golden. But for most +1's it's very very chill, like no one knows if you don't go to x consult / clinic chill that you can request to do for wellness. For 3rd years, there are some +9 blocks, with rare black weekend coverages maybe once or twice a year, mostly have goldens when on a +3.	95% at Tufts Medical Center (including the Continuity Clinic).

Desk/nursing staff are great about scheduling, triaging patient messages, and helping to limit administrative burden when on outpatient. Social work, case managers, and pharmacists around on pretty much every service.	Depends on service. Hospital medicine services are 2 day interns, 1 overnight intern, 1 senior resident, 1 faculty, and 1-2 medical students.	6-10 (depends on the service)	Short call/long call (schedule on medicine is long call day, clean up day, short call day, clean up day, etc.)	12 hour shifts 6-6, half are nights	Yes (4-5 weeks total during intern year on medicine, neurology, and CV services)	Very robust float system. There is always people on primary float (which is just a week of doing nothing unless you're called in) and secondary float (people on elective blocks who will be called in to cover if primary float is already used up). No need to use vacation time for any sick days. Conference coverage will also be set up for you and does not require use of vacation days.	Y	Intern can leave early on short call days and sometimes on non-call days	Noon conference daily (free lunch). Morning report specific to whatever service you are on. Also, huge online video library of didactics (eg, noon conferences, grand rounds, etc.) from all specialities/fellowships that you can access.	PGY-1: 1  PGY-2: 4  PGY-3: 4+	4 weeks (3 1 weeks blocks + 5 flex days) + up to 10 paid days/year to attend research conferences	Yes (gyms downtown and at Saint Marys hopsital both with 24/7 access, flat fee of $25/month to access both or free if you bike to work >4x/month)	Lunch daily at conferences + generous with $ loads onto card for call	4+4 schedule is great. Lots of elective time PGY-2/3 years to tailor your schedule (clinical, research, teaching). Very collegial environment with a flat hierarchy. Faculty definitely committed to teaching/resident education. Incredible resources including ability to take 10 additional days/year to attend conferences with $14,000 in annual funding for research travel provided to all IM residents. Rochester may not be for everyone although it is very affordable on a resident salary and the city has experienced a lot of growth over the past 10-15 years due to a large investment in the city by Mayo. In terms of patient population, Mayo serves a large local catchment area but also gets patients from all over the country/world. All of the resources make it easier to set your patients up for success and they are generally very appreciative of the care they get here. WIll see a diverse range of patients/conditions given the mix of patient populations but also a higher number of relatively well-off patients on certain outpatient subspeciality rotations compared to other places. Resident continuity clinic sees a higher percentage of underserved patients compared to non-resident community internal medicine practices. Also tons of opportunities to volunteer, including providing free care to uninsured patients at The Salvation Army's Good Samaritan Clinic.	0

Cardiology fellows often come and give lectures to residents/interns about cardiology topics and applying for Cardiology fellowship. Cons: Less emphasis on medicine and more on specialties which can be a plus/minus. Requested electives and mentorship are limited due to size of the class. The autonomy of the program is severely limited with staff/fellows making most decisions on ICU/Subspecialty and staff micromanaging interns/seniors on general medicine services.	0

Most residents live in apartments with included gyms.	Catered lunch from local restaurants with a variety of options for all types of dietary preferences are provided in all sites during the week. 8$ meal stipend for overnight calls. For overnight calls, dinner at CUH is amazing, Parkland mid, VA has nothing open after 7pm so UberEats  - At Parkland, noon conference food is from some surprisingly high end Dallas restaurants - good thai, salads, mediterranean etc. - Clements noon conference food is like cafeteria style, and its pretty hit or miss.   Also access to physician lounge at CUH, which has soups, salads, and sandwiches stocked during lunch.	Very nurturing program that will really allow you to grow as an independent clinical decision maker under appropriate supervision. Great research opportunities for followship. Want to do pulm/cc?
