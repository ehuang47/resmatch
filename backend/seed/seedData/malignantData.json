Our Jeopardy/back up call system, unlike others, still require us all to work while on backup call with the possibility of being called in for additional shifts even that same day if someone calls out. Recently, the program came under fire for trying to pull residents from the Jeopardy pool to cover APP night shifts in the MICU.  2. We have some of the lowest procedure rates out of any of our peer programs. Very few of the residents are signed off on any procedures. Several contributing factors, partially cultural and partially logistics. Again, priority is to scutt work always. Attendings are often unavailable to supervise. Fellows are not inhouse overnight nor in the MICUs. We end up having to ask other services and/or APPs to put in lines for us.  3. many more    Saving grace for this program are the residents.

I'd say you work hard for sure, but nothing abnormal for a decently sized academic program with ample research and fellowship opportunities. Residents cover 4 large hospitals, including a 1200-bed tertiary referral center for the state with 120-140 ICU beds. The residents I know are happy with the program, appreciate the autonomy you can have, and the collegiate atmosphere. Multiple rotations I've had were set up as group rounds where pimp questions were asked openly to everyone on the team, from fellow to resident to med student, and answered in an educational manner to everyone."

Medical students are super protected and research / scholarship is encouraged. Board pass rate is great and fellowship match rate is great too. Would rate it as one of the best residencies I've seen with resident happiness and work life balance.",
    "comments": "I am a current PGY3 of this program and have been here since day 1. Our program name is Southwest Indiana Internal Medicine residency. Because this was a brand new program 2.5 years ago there have been ongoing changes as the program grew and was evolving, which is expected, and which residents were and are involved in. Yes, the program is on 2 sites 1 hour apart in different times zones. However, all of this information is disclosed to applicants and also listed on our website. Thus, all current residents and applicants interviewing are aware of this. For residents who do not want to drive, groups of us have gotten houses/apartments in Vincennes that we split rent amongst ourselves and stay in when we are working there as most residents live in Evansville. Completely disagree with low case load in Vincennes. I have worked many floor months/ICU/nights in Vincennes and each team has never carried less than 12 patients to start day off with on a floor rotation. On average each team starts off with 14-16 patients minimum and then will get admissions throughout the day (usually 2 per intern, so 4-6 per team). Each team is usually comprised of 3 interns and 1-2 seniors. Rarely are all 3 interns present together on any given day when you factor in clinic days and days off. Thus, most days 2 interns are on and perhaps 1-2 seniors depending on schedules. Just like any hospital there will be busier and slower months, with that said there are almost always plenty of patients. This year, 2022, is our first year of a complete class. There is no way changes can be made \"quickly\", especially in a large program like ours. We have monthly meetings as a residency with administration to discuss issues as they come up and propose changes. Not to mention we also have a residency association with residents we elected to represent us as a program. Fellowship match was successful this year, as it is our first year of an entire PGY3 class. There are ZERO malignant attendings present at either hospital. If you show up, be professional and strive to be a great doctor you will succeed here, and your work and effort will be appreciated by all staff/attendings/administration. We do have support staff shortages just like most hospitals and businesses around the country due to COVID and economy right now, but we just deal with it. There is a gender gap and more men have historically matched here simply due to the match algorithm. The exact numbers are... PGY 3 categorical (14 men, 4 women), PGY2 categorical (14 men, 2 women), PGY1 categorical plus prelim (19 men, 5 women). All of this is once again available on our website. We definitely have lots of diversity when it comes to pathology. Cultural diversity is lacking but this is southern Indiana and one can not expect the diversity you would see in New York for example. Every program, and business for that matter will have a couple of individual residents (employees) with \"issues.\" But that is the minority in our program and MOST residents are not affected by this. The program addresses individual resident problems accordingly. Overall, this a fine program, its not perfect, but nowhere is or will be if that's what you are expecting. Lastly, this program is not malignant, far from it."

Attendings are supportive, as are the chiefs and co-residents. Also true there's lots of operational dysfunction and slack is picked up by residents. ECGs overnight are done by residents, some RNs refuse to suction(!!) so guess who has to do it, residents responsible for getting outside hospital records, and not infrequently making appointments, outpatient techs barking at residents that if they want the vitals on time then to do it themselves, the list goes on and on. It kinda sucks, and quite frankly without strong personal ties to NYC i don't think it's worth it, but also doesn't reach malignant levels. i can't speak directly about other programs, i would be extremely suspicious of any NYC program that claims there's no scut, and cornell is actually supposed to have some of the best ancillary support in nyc.    historically, cornell IM definitely used to be malignant, was on probation in the 90s led by a PD whose philosophy is that work-life balance is detrimental to training. He actually still attends on service and is considered a beloved figure. He gets upset when residents bring up work-life balance, he believes it is a false concept, and that residents should be wholly devoting their entire lives to medicine. Also historically, there have been IM residents who have taken their life, though I honestly don't know how much the program's malignancy was contributing, if any at all. Cornell was the site of the Libby Zion case where a patient died, and this led to instituting duty hours. it's changed a lot since then. but...it's still nyc, during covid the hospital proposed to not pay residents who had to take time off because they contracted covid. it's like food that's about to go bad, it's not bad yet, but the smell is not quite normal either"

PD is a nightmare if you dont drink her kool aid. im averaging 70-80 hrs in floors and units. if you do not fit the specific mold, dont come here. monte is so disorganized!! nothing that you order ever gets done, but you get blamed. guilty until proven innocent, or even then, still guilty. they fired one faculty last year for a personality disorder and there is another problematic one. dont be fooled by the garbage pizza/food they provide, save your sanity. was told someone is supposed to read evals once per year, then look at frequent comments, then maybe do something but likely not. hard to see change!    09/2023 I think monte gets a bad rep online. It definitely has its issues, but TBH, I've never felt like it's much more than my friends at other programs. Intern year you do a lot of floors, but it's q4 long call (till 8 PM) but otherwise its 7a to 2-5p depending on how you're done. I don't think I worked more than like 70ish hours intern year. As a senior, q2 long call when you're on day floors, but that's only 4-6 weeks this year. Units schedule is a little rough where it's probably ~70 hrs a week as an intern and the senior schedule is short (7 to like 2-5, 24-27 hrs shift, post call, day off). I would say night floors does kind of suck because their way of adding education is to make us stay to present (so night shift is usually 8P to 9-10A) 5 days a week. Would also agree with units and weekend coverage on clinic there are a lot of sometimes exhausting switches. Weekend coverage is 2-3 clinic weekends your intern year and every clinic block your resident years (I would say though with the increased elective and non-floors/units rotations I've had more goldens as a senior than an intern). Re nursing staff, monte has a nightmare rep, but honestly usually pretty good. Georgraphic so you get to know them well. Some (like 3 known assholes) in the MICU cause problems, but generally I've had good experiences with them. Attendings vary in quality, but there are a lot of great ones that push reaaaally good EBM. Very sick patient population and the hospital itself is pretty dysfunctional, so you do end up having to get comfortable taking care of unstable patients. It generally feels like everyone is on the same team though (Usually attendings are understanding and will help if things aren't getting done). I love my coresidents and think they're an exceptionally compassionate, and smart group. Other cons is that it's deep in the bronx, so best option is to live UES and have a 45 minute commute. PD just moved to a different organization, and our interim PD is probably going to take over, so we'll see how it goes. Not a part of it, but would also say the PCSIM faculty are AMAZING. Also if you're interested in addiction med, monte is absolutedly a great place to learn. Re scutt work: rarely draw labs, usually ultrasound guided/A stick for patients that are hard sticks or in rapid responses. Transport only for unstable patients (not actually transporting them, just monitoring them). Definitely more time than most programs talking to imaging techs or ancillary staff to try to get things done.",
    "comments": "just a really toxic place. don't come here. very much a workhorse program, which is fine. But emphasis on admitting and discharging, as it seems attendings get a big fat paycheck/raise from volume. This leads to ?admits and same day discharges quite frequently. I have broken duty hours and told it's a result of my lack of efficiency? Seniors don't have a cap on # of admissions, so can easily admit 12+ patients a night, which you have to stay for the morning of to present. You cover wekends on EVERY clinic block, so the schedule is not really 6+2, but 7+1, and with how busy nights can get, it makes coverage all the more frustrating. Noon conferences are terrible and poorly run. Not so much an emphasis on teaching, which is sad considering how sick patients can be. Easy to practice reflexively, due to how quickly things turn poorly, but hard to process what is actually going on. I wish I went to a place that ran more slowly so that I can think through and actually understand what I'm doing. Plus program is so big that you barely feel like you know who you're working with. Save yourself the hassle. There are many other programs out there in a similar league as this place, but a higher emphasis on resident wellness."

When a nurse can't get a blood draw the resident is expected to go straight to an aterial stick which was absolutely shocking to me. I personally saw or performed an a-stick at least 4x/wk for routine labs. I have seen *zero* at my home institution. Attendings and residents are extremely overworked. My attending (APD) was worked so hard that it was physically affecting his health - he was attending a 30+ patient oncology floor on top of being the medicine consult attending and then attending in resident clinic in the PM, while only getting every other weekend off. The seniors were overall not strong and would be gone doing admissions, leaving the interns to fend for themselves for 90% of the day. The overwork undermines patient safety and leads to a culture of sarcasm and humiliation - Though I do not believe that this is ill-intentioned, I think everyone is just so tired that they have no bandwidth left for actual teaching. Morning and noon conference is hit or miss, and 1/2 to 2/3 of the attendees literally cannot hear the presentation due to space issues in the hospital. No food provided ever! I know I only listed bad things but I did generally like the people and it does overall feel like a friendly program among the residents, and the hospital is a fun area near Prospect Park and with a good amount of yummy food options nearby!"

While I was a student they hired a law firm to investigate mistreatment (specifically racial mistreatment). When I was on rotations very few of my peers or superiors were non-white (12 of 160 people in my class were non-white) and I endured some not so great comments here and there. It does have that subconscious impact on you and can be isolating if you don’t try hard to find your crew. I’m now somewhere way more diverse and it’s been a real breath of fresh air. Not saying it’s impossible to thrive at OHSU as a resident of color, just something to know about before you interview. I know the institution is doing a lot to improve the culture and grow. At the end of the day you drive your experience, but it’s good to know all the facts. <-- residency experience is different than the med school experience.

    "comments": "I am also a resident - this place is malignant. multiple residents last year failed boards, match numbers are twisted bc several residents feel so discouraged that they need hospitalist years before applying, they have had to fire several pgy3s, the sick call/jepardy system is completely broken, several residens dissappear for several weeks at a time causing others to carry more work. the program leadership literally cant even recognize us in the hallways thats how little they know or care about us"
