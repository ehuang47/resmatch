UMass		The IM inpatient side is rough. Morning report is from 7:30-8:30am and rounds start at 8:30am pretty consistently regarless of attending. Sign out is a 7 am but we are told to come in "as early as you need to chart review and see all of your patients before 7:30" which for most of the residents looked like 6:15-6:30am. The drip system also made it hard to get out on time, residents were frequently staying late. Sign out is at 6pm but with the "drip" admission system the team can get new admissions until 5pm. If you get a new admission at 4:45-59pm there's no way you'll get out on time, and this seems to happen multiple times per week. I saw residents frequently working 6:30am-7 or 8pm

Central Michigan U		Comments appear to have been deleted by current program residents. However from the edits: : "All the residents are in a terrible condition. They just want to move out as soon as possible. The APD and PC left and their own med students don't even apply there. They let go of a PGY-1 due to some paper work issue and their peds program fired one PGY-2 as well. They have kept a PGY-3 after graduation as well. Terrible program as of now with terrible place to live in. --Reply: PGY-1 who was let go lied on their ERAS app and it was discovered after several issues with the resident not completing work/lying. They fucked up multiple times and lied about completing work they didn't, even copying forward attending notes from weeks prior (this is the tip of the iceberg of problems). Dude was strongly hated by most if not all residents. PGY-3 who was held back didn't meet ITE standards to pass boards (happens at lots of programs). Not really a terrible program, idk what you're talking about dude. APD become program director at another program, a reasonable move.">>>> I am not sure why most of the residents were not aware of the real reason that led the resident to get fired but still no resident said any good things about this program.

Per resident feedback:   There is no teaching service, attendings are seeing up to 40 pts, often missing rounds, very self-led learning, hours hard but then have to try to learn on your own. Considering getting rid of 4+1. 1/5 residents matched in fellowship this year. In-house fellowships have never accepted their residents. Many residents feel underprepared for complex pts because it is learning by sheer numbers. Also often not evidence based.     I had a similar experience with my interview here. Resident spent the whole time trashing the program, say residents throw each other under the bus, feels like they don't get support, didactics are almost entirely resident run, poor education, "low pass rate" per him (in the low 80s), the hospital is understaffed, the ICU nurses are mean, things haven't improved, the hospital brings out the worst in people, said they're not paying for Uworld anymore, program subscribed to NEJM to "improve board pass rates" although he thinks that's sorta useless. Said lifestyle medicine is just modules that get in the way with other stuff, doesn't help with boards.

Mayo	Promote the 4+4 schedule becuase they emphasize outpatient medicine just as important as inpatient medicine - for many subspecialties even, outpatient medicine is where you practice 95% of the time (allergy, rheumatology, oncology, primary care, etc.)	Current PGY-2 and I just want to add some hot takes that wil undoubtedly seem unpopular. First off, I want to objective and say that the program is not at all malignant, but at the same time is not as "flat hierarchy," as people make it seem.    First off, re collegiality. I want to rephrase this as everyone is "nice." And at the same time, everyone expects you to be nice. Now, I don't want anyone to conflate this with polite, because everyone should be expected to be polite. But Mayo expects everyone to be Minnesota nice and often times, people are taken aback and offended by relatively benign things, such as answering a question, but not looking directly at them because you're busy putting in orders in a chart. This is small potatoes, but ultimately very emotionally draining. (+1 Not OP but someone who went here)    Rochester -- often the location is thought to be a deterrant, but people often say that affordability makes up for some of it. I call BS. By no means is it as expensive as big cities like LA, SF, or NYC, but there is a significant amount of price gouging for rent and restaurants because Mayo dominates the area, and so there is an expectation that people can afford higher prices. The small number of good restaurants is a small escape from the stress of residency, but the ridiculous prices make them a sparing indulgence.     In terms of education, I will agree that for education in almost any IM subspeciatly, Mayo is second to none. I acutally want to pursue a specialty myself. But I want into IM also because I wanted to be a good generalist, and this is quite lacking. I sincerely believe the hosptialists at my mid-tier medical school were much more well-versed internists because they weren't able to so easily rely on sub-specialty consults like at Mayo. I remember wanting to start one of my primary care patients on Insulin and they attending shook their head and said, just send them to endocrine. That is one example of bread and butter medicine that you miss out on by doing your training at Mayo. It is true also that Resident clinic sees a relatively underserved population, but this is all relative and there is no denying that Rochester is affluent compared to the rest of the country. This would not be a good place for people looking to work with the underserved.     Carrie Thompson, our program director. I want to say that she is somewhat benign. However, there have been some concerns about her ability to run the program well since she starte a few years ago. There have been complaints that the quality of fellowship matches has decreased since she took over, and reports of her not advocating for her residents as past program directors have. I know this is somewhat annoying to complain about, but THE MAYO CLINIC, should not have trouble matching their applicants to good programs. I can't speak to much more directly about fellowship matches since I myself haven't even applied, but I wills say some of the complaints appear well founded. Dr. Thompson really does give off an air of "she will go to bat for you if she likes you." However, if she doesn't like you or is even neutral about you but you're a good doctor otherwise, doing well in the program, no professional complaints, she won't support you in your endeavors as she should as program director. This is upsetting because your career prospects should hinge on your performance as a doctor and not on the whims of a program director. Again, I know small potatoes in the grand scheme of how toxic residency can be, but Mayo Clinic will try to advertise itself as a perfect environment otherwise to overcome the poor appeal of Rochester, and I just want to say, that is not true at all.

Rutgers Trinitas		Current resident here. Was excited to match here in the beginning. Over 2 years I wish I was somewhere else. Program has taken my spirit from me.  - The program is losing faculty at an accelerated rate  - The faculty that remain including APDs dont care anymore. One APD became VP and now only cares to make hospital money and advance own career  - Lectures are geared towards billing and making hospital money instead of medicine  - No neurologist, rheumatologist, endocrinologist on staff  - Horrible fellowship match rate. PD/APDs did not care to submit LORs on time despite being told month in advance  - Hospitalist service is mostly LOCUMs who dont care or teach. If they do teach, often is incorrect information  - When on wards often work 13 days in a row. On weekends no patient cap (have had 20 plus patients on my own list)  - Are going to lose prelim help due to discontinued contract with outside program, will result in more work with less help  All programs have their pros and cons. This program has many more cons than worth it. Please avoid.

PD considered this, as well as a course remediation as an immediate red flag. Overall very rude and not very understanding (or willing to be). Resident interview was lackluster. Of note, there are no in-house fellowships at this place, and resident stated this meant attendings were not at all willing to work with or help mentor them for future fellowship pursuits. Lastly and most important!!! The resident noted that the entirety of PGY1 year is spent "following". This highlighted a complete lack of resident autonomy during intern year.

NYU Grossman	Current resident: I won't address the political comments in the shame comment or the brooklyn program issue. I'll be focusing more on the NYU main program in Manhattan (Tisch and Bellevue tracks). Of the major manhattan programs, NYU is perhpas the *best* when it comes to ancillary tasks. Tisch hospital is incredible in regards to lab draws getting done, imaging happening quickly, etc. I don't know why exactly the nursing at Tisch / Kimmel hospital do so much (I guess they're not unionized?) but they do. I truly feel like some days I don't need to leave my desk unless it's to assess a sick patient; it's probably one of the few places where an IM resident can practice at the top of their license. There's not even a concept of calling to make an appointment or performing your own draws, it's not even a question here. On some services in Tisch, they even have PAs do discharges for you. Truly an incredibly well-oiled machine. Bellevue is of course a different story, but in "faming" the program I would like to point out that the program leadership escalated nursing issues with hospital leadership, and now there are q4 phlebotomy rounds. This means that in day-to-day work, very rarely will you need to draw your own routine lab. You will still have to ultrasound hard-sticks, and you will be responsible in rapids & codes on the floors, but it is not nearly as bad as some other programs are in Manhattan. One thing to note is that though there is immense diversity in the major NYU hospital systems, they're also all within 9 blocks of each other. Commuting is not at all a concept at the main program, which helps with work-life balance. Finally, program leadership at the main program is very responsive and open to feedback. There have been several major and minor changes that have been addressed while I've been here, mostly resident-suggested. While the Brookyln program issue is unfortunate and honestly awkward, the main program deserves some praise. <<what "brooklyn program issue" are you referring to, speficically?	NYU has fostered a culture of silence and retaliation beyond probably any other program. They've actively encouraged residents to snitch on each other about social media posts. Besides Zaki Masoud, several residents across departments have been threatened and told to stop posting about Palestine. Regardless of your personal politics it's clearly a malignant institution if this is the environment they're fostering among co-residents. <- Any current residents can comment? I didnt get this vibe <<Without specifics on what was being posted and how the residents are being threatened, this is a relatively meaningless accusation. Politics are controversial at baseline, middle eastern politics are of the most heated nature, and it is perfectly reasonable for a program to encourage residents to avoid posting anything that can be regarded as inflammatory and offensive. If this is really of a serious nature, please give some specifics of the content and/or threats +100 << he got reinstated anwyays <<< maybe the resident should have avoided being a dumbass online      stepping away from politics, I'm disappointed with the silence surrounding their brooklyn program, their recruitment tactics, and their fellowship matches. NYU-BK may as well be an entirely different program/hospital in ERAS but instead it is listed as a "track" within the main hospital, which was incredibly misleading. NYU-BK interview day was the only way I could see any fellowship matches from their their residents, but they were extremely shady and mixed those fellowshipt matches among those from the main NYU IM program. Other than that, they seem to hide this information elsewhere online. I'm amazed someone was able to post under the fellowship match tab where the NYU fellowship matches were from, it seems liek this info was somehow leaked by smeone in the program which I really appreciate because it's very hard to find online.

If it makes you feel better, USMD and I was asked the same questions lol. And they've accepted students from my school before. >>> Why?? I mean, thanks haha but why do they ask those questions? >>> Who knows, your guess is as good as mine. Maybe PD has some algorhythm and interprets it or maybe it matters more your thinking about training / education? Either way, best of luck! Nothing we can do about it now haha.	
Woodhull		alleged resident sex parties per previous spreadsheet and reddit post. Could be "fame"-worthy if thats what you're into i guess. APD maybe part of it too << I mean if no one was coerced into joining these parties what's the problem here?? <<thats a fair point but i think its notable enough to go somewhere and i dont think it belongs under "fame", I imagine most of us aren't looking for that kind of vibe in a program. Also even if it's between consenting adults, APD (allegedly) shagging residents is poor boundaries/unprofessional << fair I overlooked the APD part, that's a power dynamic that shouldn't be fucked with, both figuratively and literally<<how can this be true? Seems impossible??!! True??? <<I can't specifically comment on the sex parties but it is worth noting that Woodhull is one of the most malignant programs in the country. Just search "Woodhull malignant" on google and it isn't hard to find info on it. They had a resident suicide 3 years ago too who specifically mentioned toxic workplace as his reason for ending his life <<program described as a "shithole warzone"

Mountain Area (MAHEC)		This residency program is HCA in all but name. Residents seem below average in knowledge base. Didactics are low quality. Mission hospital is absolutely terrible (HCA's #1 most profitable hosptial in the US). Not as many elective opportunities bc HCA is hesitant to send residents places where they arent generating money. Residents dont have access to the physicians lounge. Poor chances of matching into a fellowship. Many of the ICU attendings in particular are private practice and not used to working with residents. Midlevels were prioritized over residents for procedures in the ICU

OHSU		ED Doc Esther Choo covered up sexual assault and actively promoted the perp on social media. She's still full-time faculty I think. Information about it available on google and her wikipedia page << obviously terrible, but isn't that EM related and not IM? << It's institutionally related (+2, covering up SA is not something that just has to do with one doc, there should be an entire process for things like this that isn't different from program to program. It's an HR problem) . Their cards program disbanded years ago for something similar and most left OHSU and went to Kaiser or Providence. <also worth mentioning they just have a weirdly large # of sexual assault cases. I'm seeing 4 in the last 5 years just from my googling

Penn State			
Pennsylvania Hospital	Just wanted to add my interview experience and personal opinion here for Pennsylvania Hospital of UPenn (aka Pennsy) for future applicants. I interviewed at several programs this season, including big league, and I kid you not when I say this program is a hidden gem (+v cute). It is not an affiliate of UPenn, but rather a core hospital of the U Penn Health System (its also the first hospital and residency program in the country lol). The residents, PD and program chair were all SO nice it felt too good to be true. Residents also seemed to get along veryyyy well with each other given its a tight knit program and were super happy with the program. I was at first confused about where to rank it since in previous year sheets there is a lot of debate about why it has a very high ranking on doximity, on which it is higher than many middle tier and upper tier university programs. But after interviewing here I can kinda see why that is. The research output for doximity I think is atleast accurate, and the program is highly ranked for that too, probably due to research opportunities they get through Penn and since many faculty work at both Penn hospitals. Moreover a lot of their fellowship matches have been top tier and rivals many middle and upper tier programs. It is a myth that all their top program fellowship matches are due to IMGs with a lot of research- I know this cuz I personally checked each person who matched, and most of their top fellowship matches are MDs/DOs with normal amount of research. The program is also in a very good part of Philly. Only drawbacks I felt were perhaps high cost of living and not sure about cafteria food quality. Not sure where it would fall on prestige list but I think it is at least as good as many solid upper-middle tier university programs, if not better.

Methodist Woodlands		Coordinator sent an email with no attachments requiring us in BOLD to sign the forms. When replying to email I got an automatic reply requiring us to reach out through rezRATE with no other way to reach program. Spent significant amount of time trying to find my rezRate login/trying to register for an account. Had to call rezRate myself to find out that applicants actually don't have rezRate accounts and this was false information. Therefore, there is no way to contact program at all. The mistake itself isn't a big deal but it's the lack of ability to contact the program and the lack of communication. I know the coordinator knew about this issue at least two weeks ago because the agent at rezRate told me that he spoke with the coordinator the day before and the coordinator is aware of the issue. Yet two weeks since and not a single email to inform the applicants of this issue. No follow up email with forms to sign either. Still no emails about interview day information/link/schedule either. I understand it is holiday season though but it is only a few days out from interview day.	Email sent as of 12-31

Someone posted on reddit (now deleted) about how IM career advisors at the school asked students if they were ranking UTSW #1 to contact them so they could advocate to the residency program. Not 100% directly related to program but still kind of weird >> home student here but is this just some rumor? < home student here who did in fact receive this email <<resident here and can confirm that UTSW routinely tries to get students to market them behind the scenes. They also pay the residents to speak highly about the program, so people lie through their teeth sometimes	<< wtf that's so weird esp when they say DEI is important.  -- Home student here: I think the PD genuinely does care about DEI but the overall institution certainly does not. I have to fight for basic things (and it's now worse with the political pressure from the governor). <<I'm part of the residency committee trying to increase DEI and the meetings basically revolve around getting rid of DEI efforts altogether so we are really trying to fight this as well
