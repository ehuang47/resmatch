The vibe of the institution is relatively laid-back and faculty are very supportive of you and your goals. I've never seen a resident have to do a blood draw or other scut work on the floors. A downside to mention: The University of Arizona hospital system is owned by a private corporation (Banner).	0

Arrowhead	No	away	Personally have never heard of them or anyone else taking away interviews after sending them out, it seems very much unlike the PD (who btw is very kind) to do something like that. Folks here are very friendly and the camaraderie between residents was very evident on my sub-I here.>I rotated here 3rd and 4th year, also did a Sub-I and second this, nothing fishy going on here, residents and PD are super friendly and proffessional, great sense of comraderie >> I agree with everything said, i rotated here several times	Personally, these guys passed the vibe check. Senior residents were willing to go the extra mile to take care of junior residents, who were actively teaching interns. Residents seem happy and are friends with each other.	0

Loma Linda U	No	MS4 (who isn't Adventist)	Spent a lot of time with IM team during 3rd and 4th year. Have a lot of attendings that are very invested in teaching. The residencies are are not religious at all (meaning no expectation for residents to be religious/don't force things like prayer etc on residents) as far as I could tell. For me the biggest negative is that the hours are 6AM to 5- 7pm on inpateint (though they are moving to 4+1 so idk how this will change). I would say it's LGBTQ friendly as well. Only ever heard of 1 issue with a faculty member making inappropriage comments a few years ago and they were promptly dealt with. LLU really isn't as religious as most people think, and things like drinking/partying are fairly common in both medical school and residency and the school/hospital doesn't care about it happening. Lastly while a fair chunck of the staff are Christian, many are not Adventist (including the IM PD) so the notion that the culture is strictly Adventist isn't very accurate.	is it religious??? Is the hospital LGBT friendly for staff? Yes friendly to LGBT. Not religious at all for residency program +1 <<< religion is why they won't allow the residents to unionize	0

UC San Diego (UCSD)	No	resident	Tbh, I ranked it #1 because I wanted to be back in my home city, but didn't know what to expect in terms of the people and environment. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised. I love my co-residents, seniors, fellows, and attendings. Most of the people I've worked with are very approachable and eager to help. Whenever I am worried about my patients, I never feel alone in taking care of them. Sure, the hours can suck sometimes because we are not X + Y. But after I matched, I stopped thinking about it and it just feels fine. When I'm on long stretches of inpatient, I still get out by 2pm sometimes whenever I'm short call. The nice part of a traditional schedule is more flexibility and golden weekends in R2 and R3, which I look forward to! > can anyone tell me more about how you get more golden weekends and flexibility during R2 and R3 with a traditional schedule?	Cons? > overworked on inpatient rotations and faculty is largely unresponsive. PD is really nice but imo ineffective against the hospital admin in listening to resident feedback about inpatient rotations. Traditional schedule objectively sucks harder than X + Y and everyone just moves on like it's no big deal but any hope of switching always shot down	0

All of the residents were in good moods, worked very well together, excited about teaching, helpful and kind. Residents were supportive of one another. Attendings were also very nice, supportive of their team, and frequently checked in on their mental health if a difficult situation had occurred. I was told by one resident that the ICU at UCo is particularly great (PD is an ICU doc, worked with him for a week and he was fantastic).	0	0
Bridgeport Yale	No	PGY-1 here	Very friendly program. Attendings and senior residents are super friendly.

Emory	Yes	PGY-1, PGY-2	Big changes in the past few years prioritizing wellness and removing excessive busywork--> can you elaborate on this please?	While I agree that this program has made changes towards reform, it still has a long way to go to keep up with its peer institutions. As residents, we are cheap labor first and foremost, learners last. There are many, many examples of this.   1. Our Jeopardy/back up call system, unlike others, still require us all to work while on backup call with the possibility of being called in for additional shifts even that same day if someone calls out. Recently, the program came under fire for trying to pull residents from the Jeopardy pool to cover APP night shifts in the MICU.  2. We have some of the lowest procedure rates out of any of our peer programs. Very few of the residents are signed off on any procedures. Several contributing factors, partially cultural and partially logistics. Again, priority is to scutt work always. Attendings are often unavailable to supervise. Fellows are not inhouse overnight nor in the MICUs. We end up having to ask other services and/or APPs to put in lines for us.  3. many more    Saving grace for this program are the residents. Everyone is friendly, trying to build relationships and enjoy life when they can and supportive of one another.	0

The hospital is a level 1 trauma center and the diversity of pathologies is impressive. I have seen diseases that I thought I would only find in textbooks. +3 from another current student	0	0
Morehouse	Yes	friend	This program is known for having attendings who disrespect and humiliate medical students and residents. There is an attending here that some residents have expressed had made them cry and is abusive. That same attending is known to discriminate against homeless, and LGBTQ patients. Even once been said to have said that medicine is subjective and she bases her treatment on how much she likes the patient. It's a shame because most the residents at this program are some of the chillest and nicest people you would meet who don't deserve this. Be warned.	Is this legit? anyone wants to f/u on this?	0
Northeast Georgia Med Ctr (NGMC)	No	0	If you were on last year's spreadsheet, you probably saw the write up regarding our PD. Our PD "resigned" after certain issues came to light.

South Georgia Med Ctr	No	0	Friendly program, it's a new program so they are very receptive to feedback from residents. It is a small program and they do have a lot of areas to improve (for ex no research opportunities there) but the PD himself states that their focus is on making PCPs to serve in these rural underserved areas. In terms of academics it may not be the best, but in terms of work environment and the people, its a sweet place.	0	0
St. Francis Emory	Yes	Current resident	Current resident at St Francis Emory Healthcare in Columbus, GA. Don't listen to any of the lies this program tells you. They lie about everything. They say they are big on research, they aren't, I did a whole research month and Nothing meaningful was produced. They say they care about your wellbeing, but they have a crazy PD who doesn't care about anyone but herself and ensuring her New Program survives. The quality of rotations as a resident are horrific, you are treated like a med student and you won't get the training you need to survive as an attending or to handle a fellowship. They only choose a selected # of residents to speak during information sessions so avoid letting applicants knowing the truth about this program. They will screw you over when they have the chance.

Not malignant at all, program admin support residents incredibly throughout past 3 years. Definitely a place you will work hard at, but come out very clinically strong. Graduated residents feel very comfortable going into any setting (fellowship, academic hospitalist, private practice hospitalist). Only weak area is probably primary care (have 1-2 residents per year go into primary care)	Current PGY3. There is one female attending who is known by the entire program to be extremely abrasive, rude and hostile. Despite multiple complaints from the residents over the year, she is still on teaching service. Everyone knows about her and the way she treats residents but still nothing was done. She is now still on teaching duty at the VA so beware. Absolutely the meanest person I (and am sure plenty of my other colleagues) have ever encountered in our careers. Ask any Loyola folks and they will tell you exactly who she is.

M4 here, yeah its a busy FQHC but I did my sub-i in July and even during that chaos, residents were well under the work hour limits. Wellness is prioritized - when one of them a mental health break, other residents covered for them for a weekend. The chiefs are great, the attendings are amazing and frequently order breakfast or lunch for the team (I even had one bake cinnamon buns) on call days.

OHSU as an institution is amazing and the culture is very supportive/the opposite of malignant.	0	0
Indiana U	No	0	Every resident has nothing but amazing things to say about the PD and program overall. Amazing learning, lots of autonomy, and very hands on in wards and clinic. PD is super awesome and seems very personable and provides lots of constructive feedback/very open to feedback. Great environment, residents all seem to genuinely enjoy what they are doing. Night float and hour regulations enforced.	Also a current MS4 here. PD is dedicated to the residents, and the program has definitely had a focus on wellness in the past few years including a transition to a night float system among other wellness benefits provided to residents free of charge. I'd say you work hard for sure, but nothing abnormal for a decently sized academic program with ample research and fellowship opportunities. Residents cover 4 large hospitals, including a 1200-bed tertiary referral center for the state with 120-140 ICU beds. The residents I know are happy with the program, appreciate the autonomy you can have, and the collegiate atmosphere. Multiple rotations I've had were set up as group rounds where pimp questions were asked openly to everyone on the team, from fellow to resident to med student, and answered in an educational manner to everyone.	MS4 here: Everybody is nice and attendings love teaching for the most part. There was a huge purge of malignant people like 5+ years ago and the program is great. Would love to end up here.

Indiana U Southwest	No	resident	Not malignant, program. Faculty really care about residents and there is food everywhere. Residents get free parking and yearly bonus's as well. There is a time difference between the two sites so the drive can sometimes be tough, but otherwise great program. Only place I've been where I can talk about DnD with my PD and see them consistently. There is a lot of noon and morning teaching for the boards. Conferences are all paid for by the program if you're presenting and overall there isn't any drama between residents. No 24 shifts, there is night float. Medical students are super protected and research / scholarship is encouraged. Board pass rate is great and fellowship match rate is great too. Would rate it as one of the best residencies I've seen with resident happiness and work life balance.	I am a current PGY3 of this program and have been here since day 1. Our program name is Southwest Indiana Internal Medicine residency. Because this was a brand new program 2.5 years ago there have been ongoing changes as the program grew and was evolving, which is expected, and which residents were and are involved in. Yes, the program is on 2 sites 1 hour apart in different times zones. However, all of this information is disclosed to applicants and also listed on our website. Thus, all current residents and applicants interviewing are aware of this. For residents who do not want to drive, groups of us have gotten houses/apartments in Vincennes that we split rent amongst ourselves and stay in when we are working there as most residents live in Evansville. Completely disagree with low case load in Vincennes. I have worked many floor months/ICU/nights in Vincennes and each team has never carried less than 12 patients to start day off with on a floor rotation. On average each team starts off with 14-16 patients minimum and then will get admissions throughout the day (usually 2 per intern, so 4-6 per team). Each team is usually comprised of 3 interns and 1-2 seniors. Rarely are all 3 interns present together on any given day when you factor in clinic days and days off. Thus, most days 2 interns are on and perhaps 1-2 seniors depending on schedules. Just like any hospital there will be busier and slower months, with that said there are almost always plenty of patients. This year, 2022, is our first year of a complete class. There is no way changes can be made "quickly", especially in a large program like ours. We have monthly meetings as a residency with administration to discuss issues as they come up and propose changes. Not to mention we also have a residency association with residents we elected to represent us as a program. Fellowship match was successful this year, as it is our first year of an entire PGY3 class. There are ZERO malignant attendings present at either hospital. If you show up, be professional and strive to be a great doctor you will succeed here, and your work and effort will be appreciated by all staff/attendings/administration. We do have support staff shortages just like most hospitals and businesses around the country due to COVID and economy right now, but we just deal with it. There is a gender gap and more men have historically matched here simply due to the match algorithm. The exact numbers are... PGY 3 categorical (14 men, 4 women), PGY2 categorical (14 men, 2 women), PGY1 categorical plus prelim (19 men, 5 women). All of this is once again available on our website. We definitely have lots of diversity when it comes to pathology. Cultural diversity is lacking but this is southern Indiana and one can not expect the diversity you would see in New York for example. Every program, and business for that matter will have a couple of individual residents (employees) with "issues." But that is the minority in our program and MOST residents are not affected by this. The program addresses individual resident problems accordingly. Overall, this a fine program, its not perfect, but nowhere is or will be if that's what you are expecting. Lastly, this program is not malignant, far from it.	Current PGY-3. I have been to several programs, including prior experiences in surgery residency, and this program is probably one of the most benign programs in the USA with a PD and APD who are master educators (APD Dr. Ficalora was former PD of Mayo Rochester, started multiple residencies throughout the US to provide care to more underserved communities). The PD Dr. Singson is one of the most genuine people to work with and is a huge nerd (anything LOTR, Star Wars, does Parkour) and extremely fun to work with. Average duty hours on wards once you get past the first 3 months as an intern is around 60 hours, ambulatory rotations less than 40, and ICU/nights rotations 70-80. Again, first couple of months as an intern are slow going as you learn the EMR and improve efficiency, so it can be rough. We currently have a 100% boards pass rate with the inaugural class, several fellowship placements. We have a resident association, new PGY-4 chief residents, and monthly town halls to voice concerns. Only negatives really about the program being the drive between sites (Evansville in CST, Vincennes in EST, 1 hour drive between sites, add extra hour with time zone change or subtract one hour depending on which direction you are heading). Most attendings are extremely relaxed and are on the younger side (early 40s). There is a CT surgeon at Good Samaritan that is notoriously blunt and short with residents, but the hospital has no other CT surgeon there so its not like they can just fire the CT surgeon. But we don't work with this surgeon outside of giving her consults. There is a nocturnist at St.V that is like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory and can be a little spazzy and finicky, but he has periods where he is one of the best educators as far as procedures. In response to resident feedback, the program has shifted residents away from working with this individual to other nocturnists while working our nights block. Heck, we don't even have call. We have a dedicated nights block instead. As of 2023, there have not been concerns raised to Exec committee about any other attendings besides these two aforementioned. In prior year's excels, there was a comment carried forward by a disgruntled PGY-1 prelim in the inaugural year of the program who was extremely vocal and left some fairly baseless comments about program admin not responding to resident's concerns. This resident was known to be extremely demanding of program administration to make rather unreasonable changes in extremely short amounts of time, with poor insight into the administration politics and funding status of both teaching hospitals. He wasn't necessarily aware of the internal policy and procedure that had to be followed to address his concerns. Examples of program admin responding to resident feedback include (upgraded call rooms, locks on call room doors, resident lounge with La-Z-Boy chairs at St. Vincent, meal tickets for essentially unlimited food at one of the hospitals and meal tickets for unlimited food on weekends at another, improvement in quantities of free meals delivered to break rooms prior to noon conference, incorporating TopHat to track noon conference attendance, incorporating a couple of a Code Blue/RRT training sessions per block with inpatient teams). So, while the first inaugural year of the program in 2020 had some logistical hurdles to tackle, they have been well dealt with for the most part. I definitely would not have picked another residency given my experiences here.

MercyOne Des Moines	No	MS4	Currently on sub-i. These are THE happiest residents I've ever met. Amazing PD, very kind and supportive. Most research is in the form of case reports, though many desire fellowships in various fields. High retention rate. Lunch hour didactics and 1-4pm Friday didactics, some morning stuff. Clinic is one 1/2 day a week, though they round at the hospital in the AM > clinic > return hospital instead of a dedicated ambulatory week. TLDR, very happy, collegiate work environment. Poor research opportunities.	0	0

U Kansas Wichita	No	intern	Really happy to have ended up here. Access to very high acuity patients rotating at 2 700+ bed hospitals. Exposure to a lot of critical patients. Specialists/Consultants are all very helpful and get to know you individually making it easy to consult or curbside when you need to. Attendings give you a lot of autonomy while also supporting you with what you need.	Sub-I: When not on long call (every other), you leave when the work is done (2/3). Amazing. LOTs of electives built into residency scheduling. Access to ultrasound and procedures though was not utilized whatsoever when I was there. Interesting cases, supportive staff, didactics were good. Attendings are there, but serve a peripheral role with the seniors overseeing interns. Lots of inherent trust and autonomy - good or bad? Overall chill, supportive environment.	0

Friends who were stressed/burned out were able to take time off when they needed to do so without issue. Support from pharmacy and nursing (the latter for the most part) is great. My only complaint is that the residency is light on procedures. Overall, I would choose this program again without hesitation	0	0
Brigham & Women's	No	away	MS4 on MICU service - Amazing and supportive residents and fellows who genuinely care about supporting your learning and your passions. Residents seem to have relatively good work-life balance due to alternating long and short call schedule. Attendings are always there if you need them but really encourage the fellows and seniors to run the show. Support staff is absolutely incredible. Nursing, respiratory therapy, and pharmacy will even go out of their way to teach you. TONS of free food (catered lunch every weekday, attendings/fellows bringing snacks, etc). Downsides I've found so far is that noon conference isn't protected, even on General Medicine floors, and some residents have to do a "corkscrew" schedule that alternates days/nights which sounds absolutely horrible. Oh... and the whole Dana Farber thing :'((	0	0

Tufts	No	residents, sub-i, applicant	<< did a sub-I here in Sept. New PD started this past year and is very nice. Also met with Dept of Medicine Chair who helped hire new PD and is looking to expand the IM residency program. Tufts is also bringing on more hospitalist teams to help with patient load but the inpatient services (usually 1-2 interns and 1 senior) are still busy is what we were told.	At the interview social on 11/03/2022, the new PD Dr. Finn seems well-liked by residents; Dr. Finn is looking to expand the IM Program size, has added nonteaching teams to reduce # of low-yield patient caseload, and chiefs seem very willing to listen to residents and be comforting. Interview day seems to confirm my gut feeling that Dr. Finn, the new PD, is looking out for residents.	Closed peds program recently which is generally not a good sign (means the hospital system is going broke) - Not true, our hospital has met all financial obligations, is expanding our liver transplant center, remodelling inpatient units, increasing resident salaries, providing yearly stipends, matching retirement contributions, expanding our residency program, etc.

UMass Baystate	No	away	I would not describe as malignant but also not sure I enjoy the learning environment; I witnessed a lot of interns being quite coddled, with gross negligence / incompetence that probably SHOULD have been addressed more seriously. Some of the program leadership is quite passive aggressive and weirdly "sweet." The residents are chill though and overall like each other. Mix of excellent attendings and kind of irritating / inflated self-worth ones, but none that try to put you down or make you miserable. Very -friendly program.	0	0

DMC/Wayne State U	No	0	residents are cheap labor, the hospital is falling apart and residents are expected to pick up the slack for staffing issues. your experience year to year depends entirely on if the chiefs care or not. We have good chiefs this year so thankfully things are better. You may not routinely hit 80 hour work weeks but it regularly feels like you do because you get little to no support. We are the bottom of the totem pole and get no support or respect from 90% of people in the hospital, which extends from nurses/SW to faculty. also if you wanna do a competitive fellowship good luck finding a research mentor LOL	<jesus x3    second this post, have heard terrible things about DMC from previous med students who rotated there/current residents. I was told to not even apply it's so bad < also have been told to not apply/rank very low from prior med students, residents seemed a bit defensive/said some red flag things during recent meet and greet	Current intern here and damn, who hurt you OP?! Personally, I've had a fantastic experience here and the transition into residency was pretty smooth. We have a cohort system, and I will say the people in your cohort make it or break it, but the camaraderie even between cohorts is pretty good. I won't deny we do have a nursing shortage and staffing issues, but in my experience following the golden rule helps a lot. Be nice to the nurses, social workers, support staff and acknowledge we're all just trying to do our job. If you make their life easier, they'll most certainly return the favor. Faculty are generally pretty good; some make more time to teach than others. Overall, I'm happy and would pick this place again.

PD and APD are very invested in their residents learning. LRH has unveiled a really nice GME suite with a gym, multiple large study rooms with computers and couchs, call rooms, and free food and snacks for all students and residents that are replenished weekly.	0

Wash U	No	PGY2	Incredible program, extremely supportive administration, wonderful coresidents. Our schedule is literally the best.

CCU is 4 on 2 off, 4 on ect. We only do 1x 24+4 hr call/ year for the first two years a the VA. ZERO 24 hr call besides that. Teams are Senior/intern/intern with hard intern cap of 8. We get a crazy amount of time off - 14 days sick, 21 days vacay, 7 personal, 7 day reading week, 3 bereavement, and academic days. We get fed 4-5x a week and get food vouchers to use in the cafeteria. There is no better place to train with as crazy good a schedule we have.

U Nevada Reno	No	resident	Currently soft intern caps of 7-8 at Renown and 8 at the VA. Never took care of more than 8 patients at a time as an intern, usually had 5-7. No 24 hour shifts, just night float. Worked at most 75ish hours (scheduled for night float) in a week. Chill program, residents generally chill and get along with one another. Generally chill attendings, able to joke around with most of them. moving from 4+1 to 4+2 which will reduce overall number of hours worked, produce more "golden" weekends, have a dedicated academic half day, plan is not to have more than 1 week night float at a time, and working in 5-6 "flex weeks" per year where you are basically the backup but have no scheduled clinical work (meant for wellness, catch up on admin stuff, board prep, etc)	0	0

Rutgers Trinitas	Yes	Current resident	Current resident here. Was excited to match here in the beginning. Over 2 years I wish I was somewhere else. Program has taken my spirit from me.  - The program is losing faculty at an accelerated rate  - The faculty that remain including APDs dont care anymore. One APD became VP and now only cares to make hospital money and advance own career  - Lectures are geared towards billing and making hospital money instead of medicine  - No neurologist, rheumatologist, endocrinologist on staff  - Horrible fellowship match rate. PD/APDs did not care to submit LORs on time despite being told month in advance  - Hospitalist service is mostly LOCUMs who dont care or teach. If they do teach, often is incorrect information  - When on wards often work 13 days in a row. On weekends no patient cap (have had 20 plus patients on my own list)  - Are going to lose prelim help due to discontinued contract with outside program, will result in more work with less help  All programs have their pros and cons. This program has many more cons than worth it. Please avoid.	0	0

Columbia	Maybe	friend, current resident	Nurses refuse to do blood draws, make the intern do them. Intern transports all patients on ICU rotations <-- They have phlebotomists that do blood draws, the nurses don't. IDK about transport but our residents transported ICU patients too because they have to have a doctor with them <---- and if the phlebotomist is late, who's doing the blood draw? also, resident accompanying an ICU patient for transport is not always the case at every hospital, and an example of how people in NYC think something is normal but it's actually not. the ICU nurse or a PA can do this. what do they need the resident for? if patient's on pressors and has an a line, the ICU RN is more than capable of titrating pressors. if they're on a vent, RT will be involved anyway. and if they code, the ICU RN knows how to start the code and call for backup. sending a resident for transport is seemingly normal in NYC but doesn't accomplish much and is not the case at other hospitals. this is not a criticism of Columbia specifically, just of every hospital in NYC. people who've only trained in NYC don't know much of a backwater it is for ancillary support, and just think it's normal because they haven't been elsewhere	0	0

Cornell	No	0	i voted non-malignant. honestly surprised at the malignant votes, i also don't want to discredit anyone's experience and would be interested to hear why they voted that. in my experience, PD cares deeply about the residents, as do many of the APDs and administrative staff. Attendings are supportive, as are the chiefs and co-residents. Also true there's lots of operational dysfunction and slack is picked up by residents. ECGs overnight are done by residents, some RNs refuse to suction(!!) so guess who has to do it, residents responsible for getting outside hospital records, and not infrequently making appointments, outpatient techs barking at residents that if they want the vitals on time then to do it themselves, the list goes on and on. It kinda sucks, and quite frankly without strong personal ties to NYC i don't think it's worth it, but also doesn't reach malignant levels. i can't speak directly about other programs, i would be extremely suspicious of any NYC program that claims there's no scut, and cornell is actually supposed to have some of the best ancillary support in nyc.    historically, cornell IM definitely used to be malignant, was on probation in the 90s led by a PD whose philosophy is that work-life balance is detrimental to training. He actually still attends on service and is considered a beloved figure. He gets upset when residents bring up work-life balance, he believes it is a false concept, and that residents should be wholly devoting their entire lives to medicine. Also historically, there have been IM residents who have taken their life, though I honestly don't know how much the program's malignancy was contributing, if any at all. Cornell was the site of the Libby Zion case where a patient died, and this led to instituting duty hours. it's changed a lot since then. but...it's still nyc, during covid the hospital proposed to not pay residents who had to take time off because they contracted covid. it's like food that's about to go bad, it's not bad yet, but the smell is not quite normal either	0	0

Their fellowship match rate speaks for itself and since the Chair is a famous, his letters are very influential for fellowship. Residents seem very content and work together like a family, but before starting residency they also found their PD weird.	0

Lincoln	Yes	current resident	This "resident" should probably explain what has been done to prevent future suicide/burnout rather than arguing that there were 2 rather than 3 suicides... <<He's desperately trying to protect the integrity of his "home" program lol how pathetic. <<malignant cultures should be reported and fixed, not hidden and perpetuated.<< I know 2 of the three people who killed themselves personally, apparently the PD would threaten to take away their visas should they not listen to what he says.	Another resident committed suicide in Lincoln bringing the total to 4. When the fuck would the ACGME wake up and take some action against them ? PD has temper tantrums; yells and berates residents as if though they are his children. The fear turns residents against each other. They develop a Stockholm syndrome, they are afraid of him but praise him. To be fair, he is very big on resident education and is very intelligenet. However, more than one resident on probation, fearing loss of visa; this spreads fear to the other residents. GME office even more malignant and will treat residents poorly. Most attendings are very nice and helpful. Residents are overall very nice people.	I was a resident there. I personally loved it. It's a rough place to work but you leave a very strong IM doctor. A lot of IMGs without support systems so unfortunately they had the suicides but the PD and faculty are not as toxic as made out to be.

Montefiore Moses and Weiler	Maybe	resident	montefiore medicine in bronx is incredibly abusive. hours suck. nights work 8pm-11am or later presenting during next day. a million random night to day flips with little though to your schedule. admin abusive. residents alternate between catty tattle tales and anger management disorder. <25% of IM residents here normal tbh, weiler hospital hard to get to, parking a nightmare. PD is a nightmare if you dont drink her kool aid. im averaging 70-80 hrs in floors and units. if you do not fit the specific mold, dont come here. monte is so disorganized!! nothing that you order ever gets done, but you get blamed. guilty until proven innocent, or even then, still guilty. they fired one faculty last year for a personality disorder and there is another problematic one. dont be fooled by the garbage pizza/food they provide, save your sanity. was told someone is supposed to read evals once per year, then look at frequent comments, then maybe do something but likely not. hard to see change!    09/2023 I think monte gets a bad rep online. It definitely has its issues, but TBH, I've never felt like it's much more than my friends at other programs. Intern year you do a lot of floors, but it's q4 long call (till 8 PM) but otherwise its 7a to 2-5p depending on how you're done. I don't think I worked more than like 70ish hours intern year. As a senior, q2 long call when you're on day floors, but that's only 4-6 weeks this year. Units schedule is a little rough where it's probably ~70 hrs a week as an intern and the senior schedule is short (7 to like 2-5, 24-27 hrs shift, post call, day off). I would say night floors does kind of suck because their way of adding education is to make us stay to present (so night shift is usually 8P to 9-10A) 5 days a week. Would also agree with units and weekend coverage on clinic there are a lot of sometimes exhausting switches. Weekend coverage is 2-3 clinic weekends your intern year and every clinic block your resident years (I would say though with the increased elective and non-floors/units rotations I've had more goldens as a senior than an intern). Re nursing staff, monte has a nightmare rep, but honestly usually pretty good. Georgraphic so you get to know them well. Some (like 3 known assholes) in the MICU cause problems, but generally I've had good experiences with them. Attendings vary in quality, but there are a lot of great ones that push reaaaally good EBM. Very sick patient population and the hospital itself is pretty dysfunctional, so you do end up having to get comfortable taking care of unstable patients. It generally feels like everyone is on the same team though (Usually attendings are understanding and will help if things aren't getting done). I love my coresidents and think they're an exceptionally compassionate, and smart group. Other cons is that it's deep in the bronx, so best option is to live UES and have a 45 minute commute. PD just moved to a different organization, and our interim PD is probably going to take over, so we'll see how it goes. Not a part of it, but would also say the PCSIM faculty are AMAZING. Also if you're interested in addiction med, monte is absolutedly a great place to learn. Re scutt work: rarely draw labs, usually ultrasound guided/A stick for patients that are hard sticks or in rapid responses. Transport only for unstable patients (not actually transporting them, just monitoring them). Definitely more time than most programs talking to imaging techs or ancillary staff to try to get things done.	just a really toxic place. don't come here. very much a workhorse program, which is fine. But emphasis on admitting and discharging, as it seems attendings get a big fat paycheck/raise from volume. This leads to ?admits and same day discharges quite frequently. I have broken duty hours and told it's a result of my lack of efficiency? Seniors don't have a cap on # of admissions, so can easily admit 12+ patients a night, which you have to stay for the morning of to present. You cover wekends on EVERY clinic block, so the schedule is not really 6+2, but 7+1, and with how busy nights can get, it makes coverage all the more frustrating. Noon conferences are terrible and poorly run. Not so much an emphasis on teaching, which is sad considering how sick patients can be. Easy to practice reflexively, due to how quickly things turn poorly, but hard to process what is actually going on. I wish I went to a place that ran more slowly so that I can think through and actually understand what I'm doing. Plus program is so big that you barely feel like you know who you're working with. Save yourself the hassle. There are many other programs out there in a similar league as this place, but a higher emphasis on resident wellness.	There was a suicide of an intern this past year and it largely was due to the internal medicine program and schedule. Also they kicked another intern after 90% of the year and it was very suspicious. interim PD is Dr. Shaines who leaves a lot to be desired (hint, hint**). The residents here all tell on each other for their own benefit. The chief residents are kiss asses who are the worst offenders. Once of the chief residents for the next year (your year) had active anger management issues. All electives were poorly arranged and never confirmed because these brand new chief residents with no experience are expected to run the entire residency. They do a poor job and mainly are chief tattle tales. I'm pretty sure most of my labs get canceled and never done which leaves patient care a shit show and guess what, you get blamed. This internal medicine program is the definition of a toxic work environment, malignant. They had several not matching their cards/GI/ heme onc fellowships in recent years. You basically need to not sleep to get any research done and there is not much here. Majority of patients Spanish speaking predominantly, a few other languages with no interpreter available, and high amounts of drug use. Patients are 100% difficult. Make sure you have experience with this specific patient population.

Mount Sinai	No	intern	Good program, treated well	<< agree, current intern and feels very non-malignant for NYC program, lots of support and willingness to make changes<<agree, friend is intern says same	Can anyone explain why some Sinai programs are unionized and other are not, and what the unionized programs offer that the non unionized programs dont? I'm confused re why the residents at some of the sites want to. be unionized, but others don't?<- I had this qu too and asked a friend/resident at sinai main who didnt know but asked an APD re why some are unionized and others not.

New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist	Maybe	Away	MS4 on general medicine floor - Same issues with lack of/poor ancillary staff as listed in multiple other NY programs. Constantly chasing down orders to be fulfilled. When a nurse can't get a blood draw the resident is expected to go straight to an aterial stick which was absolutely shocking to me. I personally saw or performed an a-stick at least 4x/wk for routine labs. I have seen *zero* at my home institution. Attendings and residents are extremely overworked. My attending (APD) was worked so hard that it was physically affecting his health - he was attending a 30+ patient oncology floor on top of being the medicine consult attending and then attending in resident clinic in the PM, while only getting every other weekend off. The seniors were overall not strong and would be gone doing admissions, leaving the interns to fend for themselves for 90% of the day. The overwork undermines patient safety and leads to a culture of sarcasm and humiliation - Though I do not believe that this is ill-intentioned, I think everyone is just so tired that they have no bandwidth left for actual teaching. Morning and noon conference is hit or miss, and 1/2 to 2/3 of the attendees literally cannot hear the presentation due to space issues in the hospital. No food provided ever! I know I only listed bad things but I did generally like the people and it does overall feel like a friendly program among the residents, and the hospital is a fun area near Prospect Park and with a good amount of yummy food options nearby!	0	0
New York Presbyterian Queens	Maybe	away	not enough ancillary staff. residents expected to wheel patients around and just suck it up. long patient lists. 45% of the population doesnt speak english but there isn't an adequate amount of language services available. >>> it's NYC, it's just how it is	Resident here. I disagree. There is phlebotomy support + RN support, you have to draw labs if they are unable to venous draws. Yes, you have to accompany transport for unstable patients, otherwise, transport does it for you. Interns start out with patient cap at 8, no admissions until mid to late Sep, cap moves up to 9. The patients not speaking English is a reflection of the surrounding community, yes it's more difficult, but there is 24/7 phone/app translators. Not perfect in an ideal world, but in an urban setting with a very diverse population, it is effective enough. The program cares about you as a resident, but yes you work hard. Take with that what you will and best of luck to all! // hey, thanks for the info. doesn't having to draw labs if they are unable to do venous draws mean there's not enough good ancillary staff, am I misunderstanding?	also disagree, the first comment know nothing about NYC residency. There's no better anciliary staff support than here tbh even including university setting hospital. If you want that cushy residency just don't come to NYC.

The hospital is very old and run down, you have to advocate for the patients to get any echos, MRIs, imaging done. This often delays discharge. Overall the hospital is very underfunded. I heard that rotating through Kings county hospital and the VA is a bit better and every resident rotates through all three at some point. The schedule on floors is 7-4pm, call is every 6th day 7am-7pm. ;	I disagree with this. Residents seem to really like the schedule (10-12 golden weekends/year, call is every 6 days) and they're all very chill. you work extremely hard and with challenging patients but the fellowship matching is highly competitive.	0

My school put me on house nights during interview season. I reached out to the resident because I had interviews to make sure to let them know and try and work out scheduling. Procedes to reem me about just trying to get out of rotations because I had mandatory meet and greets with residency programs. Makes me come in and work nights before interviews. Makes comments stating I am unprofessional on my evaluation because I asked for time off for residency interviews. I am not applying to internal medicine. I would understand them being upest if I was applying to their program.	0
Mercy St. Rita's	No	away	Small, new program, but there is a strong sense of comradery among the residents that I worked with. Not all seniors are super helpful and provide guidance to the interns, but some are phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed my month here. APD serves as preceptor for auditioners, but PD isn't as approachable on the whole. But PD seems to be much more approachable as a resident.	0	0
Mercy St. Vincent	Yes	MS3, M4	Nobody has good things to say about this program at all. From residents at the program, outside the program, physicians, school advisors and people involved in my home program residency selection. All IMGs who are toxic, highly competitive enviornment with a large workload and poor support from PD	VERY malignant and honestly abusive environment. Attendings do not teach, and verbaly state that women should not be in medicine. Residents are miserable. No comradery. <<<'women should not be in medicine'?! excuse my language but wtf! <<<<<<yes I've heard this from a couple of m4s who rotated there too - a prime reason I did not apply to this (can I say misogynistic) program	(m4) a certain attending when asked a question by patient, said "I'm too busy" and walked away. This attending also demeans residents, while "cracking jokes". This attending is also affiliated with another hospital system. However, there is also other attendings who are great and love to teach   A couple "bad apple" seniors while others are amazing. Didactics are for the most part dreadful.

Riverside Methodist OhioHealth	Yes	away	Residents throw each other under the bus. A lot of trash talking and backstabbing.

Rotated here and felt the exact opposite residents seemed to have decent camraderie and attendings were very interested in teaching. I can second the gossip though.	tiebreaker? lol < It's not malignant, maybe some catty residents from year to year.

Issue was some of the older residents SOAPed and openly talked about not being happy there because it wasn't what they wanted, created a weird vibe. I do know that the current intern class all matched at the program so maybe things are different now with more people who actually want to be a part of the program (or at least ranked)!	0	0

Oklahoma State University - Tulsa	No	M4, Sub-I	Did sub-I here as well as required rotation - residents always make time to teach students, are the normal amount of stressed on wards, but overall seem incredibly happy and support each other. Small family environment feel, and the residents genuinely seem to enjoy each other and hang outside of the hospital frequently.	Resident work hours are 12 hour shifts so they definitely do work a lot, but residents I have worked with are always happy and genuinely are friends with one another. They hang out all the time following shifts. The attendings are some of the nicest people I've ever met and genuinely care about their residents and students. My senior residents consistently hyped me up and tried to prep me for possible pimp questions, let me do procedures, and were excellent teachers	0

OUHSC - OKC	No	MS4	The PD is great, the residents are reasonably chill, and while there is weekend long call at least once on wards (12 hours per intern, with the upper level doing 24 and staying for rounds) the work hours are pretty reasonable. Residents are laid back, most really enjoy teaching (or at least fake it well) and the attendings are largely the same. The cards fellows are fantastic.	Not great education on outpatient, most half days residents have one or two patients show up if that. They're switching from a traditional schedule to 6+2 (really mostly 4+2+2), which will slightly increase the number of total half days you get over the course of the residency, but there isn't much longitudinal care at all.	0

OHSU	No	MS4	Was a med student at OHSU and now a resident in a top 20 program. Agree with other poster that faculty are extremely enthusiastic about medicine and dedicated to teaching. Felt I was really well prepared for residency. I’ll be honest thought that OHSU has baggage with mistreatment of minorities. While I was a student they hired a law firm to investigate mistreatment (specifically racial mistreatment). When I was on rotations very few of my peers or superiors were non-white (12 of 160 people in my class were non-white) and I endured some not so great comments here and there. It does have that subconscious impact on you and can be isolating if you don’t try hard to find your crew. I’m now somewhere way more diverse and it’s been a real breath of fresh air. Not saying it’s impossible to thrive at OHSU as a resident of color, just something to know about before you interview. I know the institution is doing a lot to improve the culture and grow. At the end of the day you drive your experience, but it’s good to know all the facts. <-- residency experience is different than the med school experience. According to their website with listing of current residents, about 30% in non-white	0	0

Albert Einstein (Philly)	Yes	sub-i +1	awkward vibes, none of the residents ever talk to each other. no one really talked to me. after rounds i'd sit and do nothing for like 4 hours until they said i could leave . <> I also did a sub-I here and it was also very awkward with no residents talking to each other, genuinely did not seem happy there or with each other. PD also asked some inappropriate questions during our one-on-one	Gave me a different vibe during the interview day.. Current residents speak well about the program. Would like some more insight rather than a personal experience based on "residents didn't talk to me".	0

Vanderbilt	No	Resident	Overworked. Broken duty hours multiple times. Upper levels are not supportive and have a lazy/do-it-yourself attitude. <-- not sure who this is, but I'm a current intern and I would 100% disagree. I have only ever felt super supported by my upper levels, and never broken duty hours. The workload can be heavy (as it is at most places?) but my fellow residents have been nothing but helpful and kind	<<how do other people feel? I didn't get this vibe from interview day <<<< I am a current intern and was surprised to read this. I do not personally know anyone that shares that sentiment. I have always felt supported by my upper levels. It's cliche but my favorite part about our program is the people I work with. I have not broken duty hours. Some days I may feel overworked, residency is hard, but it's not that bad. When I have felt this way, I was always able to lean on my coresidents for support.	One shared frustration among many many interns and residents currently: "Food and lunches provided by the program are an incentive to attend conference, not guaranteed” - if you do not attend conference, you will only be able to obtain leftovers (if any at all) provided by the program after 12:30. If you are too busy to attend conference, it is highly frowned upon for you to obtain lunch provided by the program.<- i think leadership are out of touch regarding how hard we work. breaking duty hours is the norm and they turn a blind eye when real concerns are brought up. we work 12-14 hours daily and get scolded over not attending conference. the reality is that patients are getting sicker and more acute, and admin even admits that the hospital has been operating at >90% capacity for the last few years. It's nearly impossible to take fifteen minutes to go to the cafeteria to get lunch, let alone attend noon conference.

Lots of research opportunities and lots of collaboration with other residency programs (surgery, transitional year, ER)	There has been an old message circulating about this program being malignant but it's a newer program with new leadership and state of the art training facilities.

U Texas Southwestern (UTSW)	No	intern, resident, intern	Current R3 here. Program is great for high volume clinical training BUT leadership is NOT supportive of fellowship application process. When asking for time off, chiefs (who are also applying for fellowship) actively deny rotation swaps/trades quoting esoteric GME rules. Chiefs are also VERY malignant when it comes to certain aspects of the program. If you are late submitting duty hours, expect a passive aggressive email challenging your professionalism. There are a lot of other programs of this caliber with good training that don't treat the residents like shit and don't allow chiefs to abuse their system of power. If you want to do advanced fellowship training and will need coverage for interviews etc, look elsewhere. This program will not help you out. > what are next years chief's going like? > have worked with 2 of next year's chiefs personally, they definitely care a lot and I couldn't fathom them being malignant in any way	Current R1 here on NY's break, < that post (E585) is carried over from the '22-'23 spreadsheet when I applied. Six months in, it does not seem accurate at all. I worked alongside R3s throughout the fellowship application process and heard nothing like this. I'm not sure what set of chiefs it's referring to. Regarding the "passive aggressive" emails, sure. The email is cut & pasted, but it's just a reminder to logon to medhub, press submit, and that's about it. I was nervous about UTSW's reputation coming in, but have been nothing but impressed by how supportive everyone from the senior residents, the chiefs, to our attendings have been. It is not malignant. Is the training more rigorous than other big academic programs? Probably. My average weekly work hours are about 60 right now. But the leadership, led by our PD, is stopping 28-hr call (outside of the ICU) and actively making changes that would lighten our workload.	0
William Beaumont Army Med Ctr	No	Away, Intern, Resident	Definitely among my favorite away rotations! The attendings are super nice and dedicated to teaching, especially Dr. Ransom, Dr. Kaplan, Dr. Baraki, and Dr. Romero. I can feel the collaborative culture among interns and senior residents.

Med College Wisconsin	Maybe	resident, M4	hospital is beautiful and we just got a brand new resident lounge (with dedicated IM space), Midwest vibes and super responsive to feedback	I am also a resident - this place is malignant. multiple residents last year failed boards, match numbers are twisted bc several residents feel so discouraged that they need hospitalist years before applying, they have had to fire several pgy3s, the sick call/jepardy system is completely broken, several residens dissappear for several weeks at a time causing others to carry more work. the program leadership literally cant even recognize us in the hallways thats how little they know or care about us	<< i'm curious about this if anyone has more feedback. <<Looks like both positive and negative comments are copy-forwarded from last years spreadsheet almost word-for-word. As a current student I dont think this program is especially malignant, people just dont really like the long call but apparently it keeps getting voted back in every year.
